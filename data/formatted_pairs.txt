You know Chastity?	I believe we share an art instructor
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have fun tonight?	Tons
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, no...	Then that's all you had to say.
But	You always been this selfish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.	What good stuff?
"The ""real you""."	Like my fear of wearing pastels?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She okay?	I hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They do to!	They do not!

It's more	Expensive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, sweet cheeks.	Hi, Joey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where've you been?	Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.	It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are so completely unbalanced.	Can we go now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You looked beautiful last night, you know.	So did you
<EOC>	<EOC>
Patrick -- is that- a.	Perm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But she doesn't want to date.	Exactly my point
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy, people expect me to be there!	If Kat's not going, you're not going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, God.  It's starting.	It's just a party. Daddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wear the belly before you go.	Daddy, no!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You the new guy?	So they tell me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.	That's her?  Bianca's sister?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about him?	You wanna go out with him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Number one.  She hates smokers	It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle	Dead at forty-one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's pretty!	Okay!  I wasn't sure
<EOC>	<EOC>
Assail your ears for one night.	It's her favorite band.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.	Don't make me do it, man
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cameron, I'm a little busy	It's off. The whole thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Cameron -- do you like the girl?	Sure
<EOC>	<EOC>
You makin' any headway?	She kissed me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the worst?	You get the girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey -- do you mind?	Not at all
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where ya goin?	Away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just upped my price	What?
A hundred bucks a date.	Forget it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's about time.	A deal's a deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you do it?	Do what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	An attempted slit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think this'll work?	No fear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say?	Who cares?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?	Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.	My mission in life.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Kat! Wake up!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Start a band?	My father wouldn't approve of that that
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, so now you think you know me?	I'm gettin' there
<EOC>	<EOC>
You up for it?	For. . . ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
State trooper?	Fallacy.
The duck?	Hearsay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that a request or a command?	You know what I mean
No.	No what?
No, I won't go with you	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My grandmother's .	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?	Hi.

<EOC>	<EOC>
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.	So Dorsey can get the girl?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Good enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"	Just for now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ever been to Club Skunk?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were right. She's still pissed.	Sweet love, renew thy force!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're completely demented.	See you next week!
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the microwave.	Make anyone cry today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have a great time, honey!	But -- who -- what --?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What just happened?	Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?	Absolutely not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you listening to, chicken ass?	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's the devil's child...	We'll all go crazy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can see for yourself.	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She said yes.	Thank God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.	You don't usually ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't you stay with us a little?	I am busy inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to go with you!	There'll be a time.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you feeling, Fernando?	Not bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father...	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You defend yourself admirably...	... for a commoner?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All I have to do is call the guards.	Call them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see?	Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say not here!  Cuba!	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chief says -- how many?	Thousands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To bring the word of God.	Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.	Chief says...
<EOC>	<EOC>
All of them!  Just lies!	Colon!  Don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.	Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I believed in you...	Give me absolution.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose we're both old men now.	You'll always be older than me, Father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to disagree.	I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.	Oh?  So you are a new man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The ocean is uncrossable?	What did they say about Granada before today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.	Surely you can do anything you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old are you, Senor Colon?	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't raise the wheel without it.	My horse doesn't work.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?	He must be replaced.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.	Then why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.	Yes.  Yes, come with me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm abused.  Don't you think?	I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you married?	Divorced.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't take you to my place.	Somewhere else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You considered becoming a prostitute?	Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?	No.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what that is, right?	No, what is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You goin' to the escort service?	You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?	This has nothing to do with your fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two heads.	Better than one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	Something back home?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.	Raw deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>

I want your best man on this!	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They just landed in the desert.	How much time is left?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drink!	To fame.. salud..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I disturbing you?	No... not at all.  Where are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome home.	Do you know how much I missed you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you calling?	Mrs. Christian.
What?	She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck... !	I promised him to Machine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said something about money.	Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.	Machine's in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's that?	Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You brought the money?	Right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excellent.	Where are the women?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.	Look, I don't know what this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?	I remember him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a dead man.	Leave him alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna kill you.	Don't bore me with that bullshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ask questions.	Fuck you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You almost went over your limit.	Fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me the film.	You'll get it when we get there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Hello... ?	Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.	It's their Presidential Suite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.	I try to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's odd.	He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.	I'm afraid I don't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, I'll take it all.	Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?	What?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.	I don't want to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.	But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rick...I can't.	Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alice, you think you can leave?	What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You alright?	Kristen...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't go back to sleep again.	I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.	We have matching luggage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been working double shifts.	Extra money, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have you been awake?	Three days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not really.	Is there something we can do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.	It's okay, we're just about there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look great!	Save it for later.  Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rick, please.	Alright, I think I see salvation...
<EOC>	<EOC>
T-T-Thanks Alice...	Earth to Alice...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Rick!	Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't get it.	Let me talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey man, we're all sorry...	She knew she was gonna die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with me?	Your distraught.  It'll help...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something wrong with the stairs?	Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?	When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Oh God!  He killed them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.	I though Freddy was just an old town story.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feeling better now?	Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta get out of here.	You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...	Don't worry, honey
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse us, dear.	It's okay, Dan
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey...wake up.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?	It's lonely in there, in my room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that who you're waiting for?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who says I don't like you?	My friend, with the funny hand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he?	He's inside you, where he hides.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, beautiful.	Jesus!  Don't do that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?	Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going?	To take a picture.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think that's the place she's buried?	If they actually bothered to bury her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You do good work, Alice.	So did Dan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.	Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got to write some of this down.	That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mark, are you okay?	Yeah.  I'm just aces.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought about that.	She must've fallen asleep at the table...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then get out!	Mark!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's Jacob?	My baby!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor woman...	No shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?	Next life.  Oh, what's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
These things are wild...  What do you think?	Makes you look like a nun--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.	I want to talk about the baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vomit?	Faint.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay.	Stick around, please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You, too?	He invited me to his house last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unidentified Flying Objects.	Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're stuck tight!	Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to let us try, Skipper --	'Us?'
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Listen!  Hear that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hear that?	The sound again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	I'm with <u>you!</u>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dave - !	What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there any way out of it?	Seems to be all around...
What about down?	I...don't know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Course and speed?	Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What course, Skipper?	Right at our one-eyed friend!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, Skipper---	Yes, Griff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now they feel it...down below.	Radiation level...constantly rising...
<EOC>	<EOC>
As we near the Pole...	There's got to be an explanation!
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	I think I should have joined the Air Force!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Determine extent of damage, immediately.	After torpedo room:  Report!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're sure it's Cyclops?	Take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the running time?	Thirty-four seconds!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right <u>at</u> him?	That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?	We can <u>ram</u> him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!	Nothing we can do, now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?	Minus three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!	Come where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Swell!	Your friend was to remain where he was!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He did!	I am afraid not.  Therefore -
<EOC>	<EOC>
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?	Obviously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I'll be - !	I'll be another!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!	Toward the Pole!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you boys up to?	Same old shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You heard the news.	I hear Twombley got shot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm okay.	Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Safety on?	Yeah.
This way.	Sun's gettin high.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No brag. Just fact.	Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like you and Gordon?	Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.	Right!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bastard's got his high beams on.	Shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm fucking out of here.	Lawford?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those are the Hoyts.	I don't care. They're out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we going in this?	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.	It belongs to Pop.
Pop?	Grandpa. My father. It's his.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's illegal, you know.	I know.
You're a policeman.	Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.	I want to go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tomorrow, Gordon.	Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the hurry?	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?	I figured you already heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you holding up, Wade?	I'm fine, fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lillian!	Where's Jill?
<EOC>	<EOC>
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.
How's she doing?	Okay. She's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me.	Tonight. Let's get together.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Strange.	Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is nuts.	Wade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffee's perked.	When did she die?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It makes me sad.	Can --?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.	How's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?	It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just do it.	Atta-go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Ma?	She's coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?	Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.	Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.	Bang!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?	No thanks. I don't drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.	Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.	You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.	I'm sorry, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom?	Yes dear?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy. Daddy, please...	Jim... for godsake!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't drink coffee.	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't leave us.	You are a resilient man, Mr.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oooooh, I'm good.	Hey, you guys back already?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was...  ...the ballet?	It was the experience of a lifetime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alice!	Daddy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy...	Alice... I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing, sweetie?	Been better, Dad... You?

There they are!	Okay, I'm slowing us down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.	Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's flying the fucking plane?	I'm doing what I can.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's dead then. They must have killed him.	We don't know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walter, if you have a point, make it.	That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They aren't answering their hails.	This doesn't make sense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.	An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.	Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?	To swear you in as President.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.	Roger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's affirmative.	Ga get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The rest of the secret service?	Dead.
How many others killed?	Nine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who did this?	We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.	why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.	Well it worked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.	Stand by.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.	How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're pointing a gun at me.	Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, or he dies, please.	Come on, Alice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four...	Jim...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.	Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?	One thing I've learned as
<EOC>	<EOC>
There goes your ride.	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.	Hold on, Alice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll not going without my family.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, we stay with the President.	That isn't necessary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I speak to you for a moment?	Can't it wait?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what?	What?
I miss you. And I miss her.	But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know why you stayed.	Please... don't start with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.	Both of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Flying the plane.

The fax machines.	No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we sending it?	White House Situation room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone should give you a raise.	Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	We're under attack.
Where's my family?	We're handling it, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One.	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You give me ulcers.	That's my job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shepherd.	Sir...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My god. I think that was a MiG.	A MiG? Where the hell are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.	Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	How long's it been since you flew, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.	They better. Fuel's almost gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
IT'S OPEN!	DO YOU SEE TEEM?
<EOC>	<EOC>
WE'RE HOOKED!	We're hooked. Hove into position.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I just wish it was that simple.

Oveur.	Dunn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut down accelerators.	Accelerators down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dunn.	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elaine.	Te...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's got to be stopped!	But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ted, what's wrong?	Ask Simon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ted, we're taking off!	Let me by, Elaine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ted.	Not now, Elaine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elaine!	Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?	Ted, there's no time to explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you afraid?	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.	Is he making any progress, Doctor?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank's the best pilot in the program.	I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.	No, I've been excited before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you got it straightened out now?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.	Roger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.	All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?	Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.	A b...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't go in there!	Don't try to stop me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was it we had for dinner tonight?	Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he have?	He had fish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just how serious is it, doctor?	Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ted, what are you doing here?	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.	Headquarters!? What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rain.	And a little ice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.	Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rats! I've lost number three.	What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See them, Elaine?	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have a visitor.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.	You promise you'll write.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'	Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I can't stand it.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How ya doing, honey?	Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi!	I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!	I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.	Okay, this is one of my favorites.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?	I will, but Jim won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roger.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roger.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have clearance, Clarence.	Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?	No, why don't you take care ot it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you feel all right, sir?	Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
In there.	Show me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...	No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill them both.	Here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?  What's going on?	Nothing.
Nothing?	Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the picture?	And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.	And still it fits?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who said that?	At the end of the bar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?	Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.	But I-- .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Screw you.	Screw me?  That can't be right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me.	Your mother mates out of season.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Matthew, you don't have to-- .	Stay back!  I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is he?	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your health...	Ta ss'trakyona'...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, let's roll, George.	To the... to the beach?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that about?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.	If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!	Ss-ai!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this about, George?  I know that look.	There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  We must do this alone.	Do what?!  George-- ?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do I look?	You look very good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?	You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hope their plumbing's the same.	It is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does that look at all suspicious to you?	Whatever gave you that idea?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get outta there!	I can't!  Do you mind!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.	Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Movement!	Position?
Can't lock up...	Talk to me, Hudson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.	Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.	How long until it blows?
<EOC>	<EOC>
HOW MUCH TIME?	PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did okay, Bishop.	Well, thanks, I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  There's no way!	Hear me out...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still nothing from the colony?	Dead on all channels.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?	Thirty-eight...simulated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.	The structure seems intact.  They have power.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One of us?	Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are your parents?  You have to try...	Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So.	So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!	Shut up.  Just shut up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told them to fall back...	They're but off!  Do something!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are there any questions?  Hudson?	How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, the CPU is on-line.	Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Save it.	Sure, Hicks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get the fuck out of here!	Not that tunnel, the other one!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got problems.	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The corner!  Ready?	Do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seventeen meters.	Let's get these things lit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well you're not reading it right!	Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go!  Let's go!	Fuckin' A!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're in the approach corridor.	On my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Locked.	Stand back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hicks, don't let him leave.	We ain't going anywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellen.	Don't be long, Ellen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?	No.  Have you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's inside the complex.	You're just reading me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like it stung him.	Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	Uh, what's next?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Range twenty meters.	Seal the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nine meters.  Eight.	Can't be.  That's inside the room!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And how are we today?	Terrible.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.	How long have I been on Gateway station?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Casey.  She's my only friend.	What about me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want you for a friend.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess we're not leaving, right?	I'm sorry, Newt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, there are, aren't there.	Why do they tell little kids that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.	Did one of those things grow inside her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Newt.  Newt, wake up.	Wah...?  Where are...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.	I know, honey.  Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Burke!  Open the door!	Look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!	Newt, wait!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy...Mommy?	Right here, baby.  Right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we going to sleep now?	That's right.
Can we dream?	Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many colonists?	Sixty, maybe seventy families.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.	Certainly!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.	Perhaps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does he look like?	You might be disappointed.
Why?	Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you know? Had you heard?	What?
The marriage!	Well, what does it matter to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was I? Tell me honestly.	You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?	Extremely clever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh - excuse me!	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.	I'm so relieved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is she a good fuck?	What??
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	I want to go!
Where?	I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?	Yes!
Why?	I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?	What?
Tish-I'm-tee.	Eat
Yes.	Eat my - ah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that?	No one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. Don't answer it!	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me one reason I can understand.	I can't write it!
Why not?	It's killing me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excellency!	Madame. How can I help you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
These are originals?	Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is miraculous.	Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come back tonight.	Tonight?
Alone.	What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not his handwriting.	No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see that you're expecting.	Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?	In three months! Papa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful!	Be careful!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's adorable!	Adorable!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Behold!	Behold!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	Hey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Behold!	Behold!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Upstairs.	Gertrude!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said play!	Michael!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a strange young man.	Yes. He is a little strange.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	Ah, now! Here she comes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a charming idea. May I see?	It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?	Majesty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A-flat, Majesty.	Ah-ha!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.	Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, thank you.	The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why so?	Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, where?	In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.	Enchanted, Madame.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, but how old are you?	Twenty-six.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.	Thank you, Sire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	Well. There it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what do you have for me today?	Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?	He's here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you here?	Am I not welcome?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.	Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, really!	This is just a game, Papa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.	But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Papa, is this your idea?	Mine?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.	Good morning, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?	Yes, thank you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.	Bene.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I've found out about the money, sir.	Yes what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where does he work?	In there, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sssh!	Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	Sublime! Utterly sublime!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?	Yes, well, it's all good fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.	Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry. No.	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.	But this is absurd!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened? Is it over?	I'm taking you home. You're not well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I answer it?	No! No, it's him!
Who?	The man. He's here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Confutatis Maledictis.	We ended in F Major?
Yes.	So now - A minor. Suddenly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Fire.	What time?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It couldn't be simpler.	First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.	Also identical?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have me?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And that's it. Do you have it?	You go fast!
Do you have it?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That will do, Herr Mozart!	Just let me tell you how it begins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing, Herr Director?	Taking out what you should never have put in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think it was really decided, Director.	Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.	Baron!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	I regret it is not too familiar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you hear me?	He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean that play?	Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you absolutely sure?	I've seen the manuscript.
Where?	Never mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.	Incredible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bravo, Your Majesty!	Well done, Sire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I be of service, Miss Price?	Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.	Yes, Doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did he say a wolf?	Yes, I believe he did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.	Come to my office, Miss Price.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What shall we do?	Tea would be nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It wasn't a lunatic.	I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aw come on, Miss Price!	Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!	Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's try a little harder, shall we?	Will you give me a break?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you dream about?	I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.	It's okay. I want to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a werewolf.	A werewolf?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you better now?	I'll let you know the next full moon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The kitchen.	Very nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Closet.	Charming.
Bathroom.	Lovely.
The bedroom.	There is only one bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's nice to see you.	It's nice to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex?	Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tomorrow is the full moon.	That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.	See you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David! Where on earth have you been!?!	I'm freezing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But...	Pull over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David, what are you doing?	Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.	Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.	What?
We had an argument. He's being silly.	I swear, I don't know this girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...	Will you shut up!?!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hopeless. It's hopeless.	David, let's go now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Officer, I killed those people last night.	You did, did you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.	Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.	Oh, come on, tell us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.	I was having a nightmare.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you cold?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I like it here.	I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Nice to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice looking group.	Listen, at least it's warm in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about it?	It's a five-pointed star.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on, ask them.	You ask them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack, we'd better go.	What do you mean? I'm starving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!	Apparently so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear that?	I heard that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could be a lot of things.	Yeah?
A coyote.	There aren't any coyotes in England.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.	Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.	Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.	It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit! David, what is that?	I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?	Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's moving.	It's circling us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the plan?	Plan?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's in front of us.	Do you think it's a dog?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice doggie. Good boy.	Walk away, Jack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See anything?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It sounds far away.	Not far enough. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack?	Yeah.
Where are we going?	I'll tell you when we get there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really scared me, you shithead.	Are you going to help me up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to see you.	Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.	This is too much. I can't handle this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not real.	Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Jack.	Hi, David.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because this must be stopped.	How shall I do it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Hirsch?	Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thank you, Doctor.	Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me.  Yes?	Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?	He's on the telephone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, there. What can I get you?	Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.	I suppose Guinness will suffice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any hot soup?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remember the Alamo?	I beg your pardon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thank you.	I'd like some tea, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Tom.	You here again? What do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We want to talk to you.	What about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.	All right, Jack, all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I	Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !	You don't have to do nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, Matt!	What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?	Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?	Now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.	John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.	Got a handkerchief?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we let the people come in?	Of course, let them in! You're late now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.	Hello, darling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?	Numbers? No, never mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Helen.	Good morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Mr. Sampson . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Helen!	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.	Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?	Yes, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, make that uniform blue.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?	Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?	I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I already told him I was home.	There you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My wife? What's she got to do with you?	No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Sampson, what is it?	Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The lobby's half filled now.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.	Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.	Mine too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.	Is it safe?
Absolutely.	It's his life insurance money, you know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Helen!	Matt, come here!
Why?	Come here, honey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!	Oh, is that so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.	I tell you, I saw them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Matt . . .	Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you say Dude Finlay?	Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.	He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.	Are you sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
for the rheumatism, you know.	What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then who changed it?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you were home last night?	Yes.
What time did you get in?	Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you fixed?	I'm okay, Matt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can ride like that?	I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I couldn't lose him.	Jim Younger, I told you--
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is healing?	Sometimes a wound will kill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!	Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's smiling.	Never a good thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.	Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhh, yeah it does.	You stay out of this, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got a problem here, brother?	Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd they --	What have you done?
I ain't done --	WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bob. I didn't...	Swear.
I swear --	Swear on Jimmy's grave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Cole.	You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yesterday.	Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Corn gonna shoot at me?	Nope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...	... Will Perry ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many of them did he kill?	Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have no shame.	Not yet. But I'm hoping.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But if we take their money and supplies...	Exactly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Bout time you got here, buddy.	What's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ride with me, cousin?	I could use the walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you boys going?	There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Home, boys. Back to our farms.	Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hands off your hip, Cole.	You're not scared, are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not now.	What is wrong with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?	She got two of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She had a moustache.	She was European!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The James-Younger Gang.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got seven thousand.	I got three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'll be the biggest score yet.	What will be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.	And I'm the better outlaw.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still smells fishy.	Then let me run the show, General Lee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dammit!	A trap.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, you're gonna rest here.	Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bob, rip up some bandages.	Pass me some whisky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Missed you, cousin.	Missed you too, cousin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cannon or Gatling?	Both would be nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...	Sadie was not a man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!	Get buckets!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another dozen out back.	They gonna rush us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The safe. Now.	Of course!  Uh, sir?
What?	Where is Jesse James?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You 'um big lawman?	Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.	The District Marshall
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!	You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?	On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?	It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.	I'd appreciate that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell were you?	I had you covered.  From back there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.	My little Web did that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Web died fighting?	Died a hero.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you say, sir?	Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank, don't you have something to say?	You're doing just fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That just might work.	Maybe, maybe...
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Big and older""?"	You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.	I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's still talking to Jesus.	What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know him?	Heard of him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.	Ma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.	Bob's upset.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're drunk.	Oh yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?	No, I --
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Your men knew the risks.	What is going on here, man?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Patrick?	Yes?

Your hairline looks like it's receding.	It's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want a firm commitment.	I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, no.	I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I'm just leaving.
But where?	I have to return some videotapes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Picked them up from the printers yesterday	Good coloring.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't come back.	I won't...don't worry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me please, Patrick.	Jesus lives, Luis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...is...it?	Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.	Patrick?

What's that, a gram?	New card. What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...	Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Just...say...no!	What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what do you do?	What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?	No. Flattering, but no.
Well...	I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.	Hello
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's my...cousin.	Uh huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL	Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
KIMBALL.	Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.	It's no problem
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pardon me, but are you okay?	Who do you ask?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bad habit.	I know. I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you rather I not smoke?	No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?	No problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah...Yale thing.	What do you mean...Yale thing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.	Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?	Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He does? You're sure?	I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?	Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.	So who was he with?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gee, uh, that's too bad.	I'm so hungry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?	I've been great. And you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?	It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?	Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.	Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think so?	You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That took some fun out of --	We're not gonna let it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?	Milo! What about --?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!	Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?	It was a hate crime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was -- different.	...Different?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great!	Look at me! I'm gonna change.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Milo?	Don't we have any chopsticks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here we go.	Great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...wanna savor this.	It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.	You're just afraid to eat it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Milo?	Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?	'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're interfaced with our dish.	Gimme the coordinates?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it your software?	Is it your dish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Milo? I'm Danny.	Oh hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool!	Would you like a Coke or something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know a lot about art, I guess.	There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Think I should buy some originals?	...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.	That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going?	Maybe I'm going too fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay. Really.	Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did this -- overnight?	You're making me young again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Milo. What's up?	Well -- you sent for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really wrote this just today?	What're you implying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It scales, don't you think?	Definitely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard what happened.	Were the flags for Teddy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gary, hi.	You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!	'Have a look?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's great! Thanks.	'Sorry about the late notice...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could've handwritten it.	I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gary, I --	You see what's hanging on the wall?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is good. Who did it?	'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hasn't affected his work, though.	Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, #2.	Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready for number three?	Let's go.
Longitude 109 --	Wait... He knows.
What?	'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Gary?	Just do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you should go.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every entry was authorized.	Keep looking.
What're we looking for?	Any irregularity in the pattern.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You calling Phil and Randy?	I'm calling Gary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come with me.	Where we going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you wanna be alone?	No. Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's great. I -- didn't know.	She saved my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How close are you?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told Teddy about you.	What'd he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meet me at the other location.	Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it's the satellite.	Let's try #2.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...He knows.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Latitude 47 degrees.	Wait a second. He knows I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So -- how far are we from the campus?	Oh we're not going to the campus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how'd you like the house?	His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe he'll get back to work.	Speaking of which...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That kid's the great white hope.	I could get it out of him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who're these guys?	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come in.	I'd rather talk about Number Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I wash you?	Groovy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In Japan, men come first and women come second.	Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?	Sak-i it to me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.	Hey, how are you?
Hungry.	Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, Austin, what have you done?	That's not your mother, that's a man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!	Austin, I have something for you as well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A limousine has just pulled up.	Let me see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate having my picture taken.	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fancy a nibble?	I couldn't have another bite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really, Austin!	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does that make you horny?	Not now, Austin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not a good time to lose one's head.	Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.	Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have something to tell you.	Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.	That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.	Behave!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything seems to be in order.	Hey, wait a minute--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, have a piece of gum.	Here, have a piece of gum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Noooooooooooooo!	Where did you learn to shoot?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Commander, I have to log it...	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow! You shot me!	Right. Okay. Moving on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quite impressive.	Thank you, Herr Doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm proud of you.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't label people here, Scott.	No, he's really evil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knight ...	Black...
... death ...	Love...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flower ...	... power ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nature ...	... preserve...
Secret ...	... love...
Hope...	... love ...
Fear ...	... love ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have I been here?	Three days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You	Have we met?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.	Promised? Who promised?
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I help you, madam ...	Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.	Impossible?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are female?	As you see.
Then you can't come in.	I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.	Really -- what happened in 1922?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?	Eh? In here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...	We have met ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My number two. Special assignments. She's --	Let me guess -- 'Father'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I resign.	You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...	Next assignment?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...	Thank you, Steed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.	Thanks, Valentine ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...	I'm already married ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doctor Peel, I presume?	And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Showers followed by sunny periods.	We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father always wanted a boy.	Really?  I fail to see the connection.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you?	Yes indeed. I need protection.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...	Thank you, Trubshaw ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?	Did you say formal? I must dress.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.	How on earth can you tell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But	Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that what you think?	Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?	Barely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This must be the last straw.	Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steed ... !	Mrs. Peel ... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You followed me.	Orders.
To kill me?	Nothing personal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could save you the trouble.	No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...	Always.  Except ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmm ... what are you doing?	Keeping a stiff upper lip?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, after you.	You don't trust me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told Mother I took care of you.	You lied.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.	Why's he called 'Invisible'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you coming?	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...	Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that you're wearing?	It's called Black Leather.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trubshaw again? What now?	Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Peel?	What kept you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.	It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?	Not quite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our chaperon.	Pity your mother came, too ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?	Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, hello ...	We want Mrs. Peel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother. I thought you were burglars.	Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weather's turning nasty.	You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright, young man?	I think so, thank you so much ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wonderland Weather Ltd.	This way ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Peel -- ?	Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...	Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --	Stay by the window. By the window.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're better than I expected.	I was at Harrow ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bang-bang ... you're dead.	You wish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One shot -- for emergencies.	That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.	If you say so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said ... one shot.	Did I? My mistake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you forgetting about something?	You are, and it's behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	Debbie's marrying Rick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Cole know about this?	Really -- you went with him for two years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at that guy. What a hunk.	Check out the other guy's buns.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.	Bobbie, what are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what we're going to find out...	I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?	Rick's got an important announcement to make.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You're kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.	Chulo, one thing at a time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you guys, what's going on?	We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man, you're losing your audience.	Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right!	When do the girls get to the party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.	I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And...	Bond... James Bond.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want any trouble.	Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.	Ooh, be still, my heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great car.	The best.
I love that car.	I'm very happy for you two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.	So does Debbie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!	Maybe it had something to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cole, what the hell are you doing?	She's mine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, everybody. Am I late?	Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?	Sure have...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the advise, sir.	Keep me informed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cole?	Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh? Wha...	I can't sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is it, lady. Last stop.	Can't I just go with you guys?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.	Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.	Your mother's not dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't trust you!	C'mon, I knew it was you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe you.	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is Cole here?	You know your father enjoys his company.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A strange wang right in my palm.	Ilene, we don't really know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.	Quiet, Mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope Ilene's all right.	I hope those guys are all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?	A real turd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great bathing suit.	I think I screwed that one once.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.	Any time, Al.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.	They'll be up there in a half hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?	What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.	They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give him the works.	That's more like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.	What's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hookers beat you up?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?	Rick, I really think I'm in love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.	Larry, you and your wife got problems?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that all the coke in the place?	That's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to share it?	Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah, I guess so.
Really?	Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.	It's Bullwinkle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oops!	All right, who serves?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome, welcome, one and all.	Rick!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The end.	No sob story is going to change my mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.	No. Let's at least finish the set.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ed... you're kinky!	The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!	No, Brett, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell is he?	Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Nothing... Let's get crazy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"We'll spend an hour with ""Nymphos Without Pants""..."	Olivier's in that, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that?	My gift to you.
Under the table!	The best table in the house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you'll enjoy this table.	So long, Father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that?	I don't know.
What's this?	Got me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How 'bout this?	Still drawing a blank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He look familiar?	Very.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, don't get into any trouble.	Take care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you guys...	Who's your friend?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reach out and snort someone.	I'm saved. Let's party!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.	Who?
Debbie.	My Debbie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh these moments do try me...	Be gentle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know Knowlton pretty well?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Biggest in two battalions.	We're gonna be okay, man...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he...	He's alive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta let me finish --	Just come down, John. Just --
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't go like that.	Who asked you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like what you've done with the place.	It's comin' along... want a beer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, an actual operating 8-track.	What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.	It works.
<EOC>	<EOC>
People actually used to pay you for this?	Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.	Yeah? What about Laura --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ya love it, probie?	I'm in heaven, Lt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...	-- Never mind.

Thanks.	Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roll the hose.	What, are you kidding? By myself?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.	Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --	Just leave me alone, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, what are you doing here?	Just... Just wanted to say hello...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?	I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything else?	What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.	We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
With grenadine, right?	When I was twenty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Arson.	Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could use a date.	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the invite.	Got anything to drink in there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is --	Just take it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	That's a dumb thing to say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.	Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Pest control.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Shhh.	What are you listening to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...	I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you pull me out?	Yeah.
Did I say thanks?	No.
Just wondering.	I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brian?	Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. McCaffrey...	Nice boat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Completely out of control.	What the hell are we waiting for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.	Backdraft.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.	I'm busy.
He just wants to --	-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gotta roll, Stevie...	I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.	I'll be there, goddamn it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't talk about my brother like that...	Here we go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stephen, what are you doing here?	Fixing my roof.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyway, down here, take a look...	McCaffrey, hold this for us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shadow.	How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.	Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Who's this?	He works for me.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.	You like everybody, Ronald.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know him.	I know you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Burn them.	And old ladies?
-- Burn them.	And the world -- the whole world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It knows us. This one knows us.	I need that report, Lt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alderman Swayzak.	Investigator Rimgale.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Inspector.	Alderman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?	Just catch the son of a bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?	Investigator...
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right, honey?	I was gonna bring it back myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what are you doing here?	He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have the money?	What money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep trying.	I'm on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He gots to be did.	Did he gots to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You truly are a dancing fool.	Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everybody say Ho!	Ho!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go niggers!	Louder.  They can't hear you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?	What do I do?
What do you do?	I'm a revolutionary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
DeLa - what's the matter with you.	You ain't happy about the green light?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with him?	Must be the pressure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, have a seat.	Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why they gotta make my nose so big?	Look at my lips.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of show is this gonna be?	Different.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to meet you.	And this is Manray.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That ain't funny.	DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My tap shoes.	EUREKA!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I have to do?	Some tap dancing, some singing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mantan?	Mantan!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!	We think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.	Dunwitty, don't leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.	It's me, Peerless.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good woman.  I trained her right.	Daddy, she's younger than me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Purely for medicinal purposes.	I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you too, Daddy.	Always keep 'em laughing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Manray!	Manray!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Manray was under our nose the whole time.	Do you know how you will use him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	This is Cheeba.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is the group I was telling you about.	Which one is your brother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just want to say good luck.	Break a leg.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Same here.	The pleasure is mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is crazy.	That's why it will be so much fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mantan, we got a show to tape.	My name is Manray, goddamnit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peerless, your father called.	I'll be right over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wants you to come and see him.	He said that?
Yes he did.	Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.	I can't go all the way down south.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.	The best defense is offense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let Myrna finish.	Thank you.  And always smile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.	And this is my very best friend Mantan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Y'know my lady Lucindy?	The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...	Oh her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I fell out of my bed last night.	You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.	You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel a song a comin' on.	A song a comin' I feel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A lot?	Enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you call him?	For what?  He left.  Not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're sure this is a good idea.	My people love me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Has he sent the challenge yet?	Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?	I will let down the steps for your honor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have no luggage.	The gentleman has nothing contraband.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.	Old fool!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel the ribbon.	Then you must get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you shaking?	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.	All right, five hundred guineas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.	The Prince left him only that choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then this must be done tomorrow.	What is to be done?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill Styles...	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you ever point a gun at me!	I'm -- I'm sorry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --	What do we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to go --	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --	Can anybody hear me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got -- I don't know, we got separated	Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
<EOC>	<EOC>
West was one thing, but this --	Shut up, Mueller.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, right...	Shut up.  West's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no need...	They're dead, aren't they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?	I'm not telling you what happened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some.	Tell me about them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I apologize --	You saw West's body.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And he'd been shot.	Yeah --
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not finished yet --	You wanna bet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --	Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He -- He made me do it --	Do what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	The creek bed --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back up.	Mueller was alone in the cabin?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohhhh, I don't think so...	How do you know that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cadet, what's your name!	Sir, Dunbar, sir!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?	Sir, yes, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck is going on?	Your weapons, Sergeant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, what happened?	West... he's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you killed him?	I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whose blood is that, Jay?	West's. Any kindling for afire?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roberto, what the fuck?	We just want to check your pack --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know it's not like that --	Do I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.	You're lying --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... I don't know...	What don't you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.	But not the only victim, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --	Stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know?	Because I was standing next to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.	Who killed Pike?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tom, where are you going --	Home, I'm done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What I said before --	Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.	Does Osborne agree?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're taking your command, aren't they?	The Senator...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay where you are.	Or what? You've gone round the bend --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hostile and uncooperative.	Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Christ	You knew Sergeant West?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something wrong?	Being back here. Gives me the willies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --	Watch me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't shoot West...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
At least you and Kendall agree on that.	What happened next?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanted to break him.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four --	Get in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hardy, what are you doing --	Isn't this how your story goes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No bodies, no West...	No death certificates. No crime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need to talk --	Seven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not true.	There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
West?	Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we shouldn't go.	The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pike and I got separated --	Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --	Oh, you remember now --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was freezing from the hurricane --	So you took off your shirt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He said what?	"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."
No one else heard it?	He whispered it in my ear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pike never confessed.	We've been making progress, I see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enjoy your flight to Washington --	Wait --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dunbar's telling the truth.	Wrong answer --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who, Levi --	Childs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?	Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank God...	What the fuck are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --	We're not going anywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So?	Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think he did it?	No --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	It's too neat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.	That's great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome to ya. What's your name?	Edward Bloom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bloom like a flower?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were expecting me?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You won't find a better place!	I don't expect to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or are you too scared?	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.	Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.	Fine, I'm doing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get the eye?	I brought it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I see him?	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see that woman?	What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...	Was she nekkid?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise me you'll come back.	I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must be Edward Bloom.	How did you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Helping people makes me happy.	I'm not convinced you should be happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.	I see. I thank you for your time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay, just leave it.	I can get it. I can just...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lord, I'm sorry I...	Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...	Go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. How are you feeling?	I was dreaming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.	No, I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did she say?	Beats me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not trying to run away?	Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you ever work in an office?	There's a lot you don't know about me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.	Oh, so you know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I ever tell you about how...	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.	I think someone hasn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The river.	The river?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me how it happens.	How what happens?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we headed?	You say...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's unbelievable.	Story of my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can I convince you to stop?	Go out with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait! I need those!	There is no softer ground than town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what are you up to now?	I'm robbing this place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is it? The whole vault.	'Fraid so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Oh.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to get started on dishes.	I'll help you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to check on him.	I need to lie down for a bit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like it, being pregnant?	I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going with you.	You don't have to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I talked with your father last night.	Did you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmm.	Mmm, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you love your father?	Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?	He's up with your father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you say you understand Josephine?	Yes. But that's a different...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was she one of your teachers?	No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That really happened?	Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he awake?	He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?	Yes. Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You first.	Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.	There's over eighty thousand here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.	It is. I did it cooking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like it?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say thank you.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What are you doing?	What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.	Leave him!
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.	No I haven't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry. You've lost me...	I'm asking what you're here for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he say?	He says he feels safe here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how long will you be in England?	Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...	You're asking for my documents?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!	Uh. Do you like England?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She says she has a secret to tell.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is bank?	Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put the fucking kettle down.	John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just leave her alone.	I'm so sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that everything?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh... Are you a giraffe?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Today is bath day.	Sorry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't understand.	Happy bath day.
<EOC>	<EOC>

They go.	Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me some money.	I don't have any money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I said I don't have any.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...	I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.	It's none of your business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to talk about it.	Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.	You don't want to talk about it.
No.	Okay we won't talk about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You...
I got what I paid for.	You didn't mind too much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	Get out
You are throwing me out.	Get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's alive!! She is not dead?	Laugh it up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	What was her name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know you can come under the blanket.	It's alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. No thanks.	Please. Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. Goodbye.	Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something else.	Okay. Promise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not mine.	It's not mine either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.	It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.	Tell me about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does it mean?	Maybe you will find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name's Sophia.	Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is the flight full?	I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have excellent English.	Thanks.
How do you want to pay?	Cash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Angela?	Yes?
I need to uh...	Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.	You take her to a doctor?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is your niece older than 12?	Oh, she older than that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This was very sweet of you.	Well. Hope you enjoy it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More cough syrup?	Can I come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still need a lift?	Yeah. Transmission's shot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	Yeah.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gonna steal my truck?	Make yourself at home. You done it already.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!	Stop what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thought you had a skirt earlier.	I got others.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The fuck you laughin' at?	You don't got half what Tehronne got.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Teh... Tehronne?	Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!	GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...	Come on, gal...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Ronnie?	Well I don't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!	Whose doin' is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.	Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!	I CAN'T!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They sure liked them devilled eggs.	You drink whiskey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You take it straight?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want another?	We drinkin' buddies now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still makin' jokes?	No joke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you do somethin' for me?	Anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me what to do.	The... chain helps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Nothin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get'chu at that table up yonder.	By myself?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	Looks like you know a song.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want you to let go.	Maybe I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever seen a train run on a woman?	Nuh-uh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How a girl get like that?	Like I told you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goin' dove huntin'?	You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heard about this morning.	We ain't here to talk about that shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You won't at the square this mornin'.	Get me ten bags of mulch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So...  That your first time?	Yes'sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I skipped lunch.	Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel better. Do you?	Yeah, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to your face?	Got in a little accident.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, hey, where you goin'?	Home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Let go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.	Charlie...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are they doing now?	Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?	Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank Abolofia.	The Wolf?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some party.	Maybe we should do something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Saving your life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you say?	Where is the subway station, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick... You up?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick, have I been a good partner?	Number five with a bullet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.	I didn't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	Nick, we can't just --
<EOC>	<EOC>
This should be it...	You said that in the last two places.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This the right place?	I hope not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Getting very weird.	I'd feel better if we had some heat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.	I don't think he'd feel it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Squid?	Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joyce can be nice.	What'd she say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cool, Ich?	Cool?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?	What does Charlie mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.	Connie...
All right, how's the new partner?	High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.	Give me a break, would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you expecting anyone?	I wasn't expecting you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do we start looking for this guy?	Where would you look for the mafia?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick!	Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.	Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must leave?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've continued working on the case!	I can see that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you get this?	I stole them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd I tell you?	There she is!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I say that?	You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...	Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yakuza.	Good.  Very good...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She disappeared... shit!	You were too far behind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't come in.  They don't want --	Gaiijin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick!	A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where does this Sugai live?	A resort city, Beppu.
I want to go talk to him.	What...?  Why?
Because he knows how to get to our man.	He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...	Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.	It's done.  You don't have to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Start it.	I can't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just one, compadre... Kampai.	Kampai.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone attacked him.	Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.  You have one?	A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that for?	Luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, Nick, we can't lose.	Why's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think we'll get him, Nick?	We can't lose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't give him any more.	He gets as much as he wants.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ich said you left.	There was a change in plans.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She ever pull down her shades?	Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be an ass.	He's on duty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need your help, Joyce.	Where's Ich?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're wrong to sell Ich short.	He drinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the wife?	You met her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're in?	The cheese...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I still think you're a bastard.	What if I chant?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep the change.	I'm taking you back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.	Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.	Time, I've got plenty of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is my stop.	I'm amused.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.	Then take it from him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How big a package we talking about?	This by this...
Dope?	Not in that company.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One guy do all the damage?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want a gun.	It is not allowed.
We're police officers.	You're foreigners.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you fill me in?	Why don't you ask your chief detective?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!	Twenty-four hours, detective.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That wasn't our deal.	You want him dead too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He knows what he's doing.	If he won't cooperate?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go while there is still time.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the point?	Not to be trapped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One man.  He must be good.	Then go get him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.	Oh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.	It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?	Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?	Had in mind something a little more radical.
What's the problem?	Death.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want more life, fucker.	Come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.	I am?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've done some questionable things.	Also extraordinary things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you staring at us?	You're just all so... so different.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, Sebastian?	You're androids.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What generation are you?	Nexus - 6.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show me something?	Like what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're our best and only friend.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going, Sebastian?	Just thought I'd...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on down there?	He's not ready yet.
When?	Tomorrow, he says.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.	Hello, glad to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think, therefore I am.	Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't like her.	You didn't like her!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.	She's not with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gotta be right for my customer.	Your customer, eh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, when do you get paid?	Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?	Day after tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.	And what in your estimation works?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...	Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I have no money.	It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.	I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Vodka!	Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.	My pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Prosit.	Prosit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to see my friends?	Sorry, don't have the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those cockroaches?	Ya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Prosit.	Prosit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like to kiss her goodbye.	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like you.	I like you too.
One more, eh?	I gotta piss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old am I?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	I'm taking a piss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you go?	Too old.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My job is here.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Taffey Lewis?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The best.	Does it eat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeezus!	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me.	And who do I go to about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's artificial?	Of course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you apprehensive?	Why should I be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You use your equipment, don't you?	So?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I make you nervous?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can imagine.	Can you?  I couldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you I'd come back.	You did?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is this?	Me and my dad.
Where is he?	Dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do people do in the afternoon?	If they are smart, they take naps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you dream?	Yeah.  Sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you cry when your father died?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When was the last time you cleaned this place?	Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?	Don't be fooled by appearances.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They could clean around the arrangement.	I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're sick, Deckard.	I never felt better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever known anybody a long time?	You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.	What's a long time?
Ten years.	Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what I think?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	Black?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this to be an empathy test?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	If she is, the machine works.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many questions did it take?	Thirteen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?	Five, maybe six.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.	Don't move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?	I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to go home?	I don't have one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?	We sure did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatcha doin'?	You scared me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look... better.	Just better.
Beautiful.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you live in this building all by yourself?	Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twenty.	What's your problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Methuselah Syndrome.	What's that?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.	Is that why you're still here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.	I keep a lot of provisions right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What makes you think so?	You're all so perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi!	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, now, that's a great one!	You like it?
Bravo!	Thank-Q!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is my new friend...	I'm Adam Webber.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go talk first, Adam.	Yes, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please excuse this interruption.	Oh, brother...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here!	No, you get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.	Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with you?	I just had a mental picture of...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I came on a bus.	Why doesn't that surprise me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?	It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, what are you doing?!	I know a short-cut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you doing that?	I haven't brushed yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.	Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
See, ya.	Why doesn't it never work out?
What?	Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got it! Wait here while I change.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait! Wait!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.	Hey, you know. I was thinking...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could we talk about that a little later?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out!	The engine is still running.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, get out!!	Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!	Sorry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You almost got us killed!	I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!	You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!	Is this your house?
Yes!	I like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.	Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.	Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.	So, what are you seeing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The guy with the underpants!	That's boring!
<EOC>	<EOC>
About clothing?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!	Look unimpressed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  Not crazy!	Do I look crazy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!	Good-bye!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought I was here to meet women.	Not that one!
I like her.	And don't be so obvious!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's ridiculous.	Maybe. But that's how it works.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam?!	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't blame you!	Eve, I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm leaving, too.	But, Eve, I would--
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Eve!	Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that a birthday cake?!	Yes, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this because of the radiation?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.	Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!	Blow out the candles!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, boy! A jacket!	Your mom made that all by herself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'est bon, Monsieur.	Merci!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...	Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.	Yes, sir.  Is that all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right on the button.	Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right?	I've never met anyone like you in my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not on him.	I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.	I just don't want to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's why little things mean so much to him.	I LOVE THIS!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.	Okay. Thank you, my friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-bye, Adam.	Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, Troy!	Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?  What is it?!	The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?	Up there!!
I don't see anything!	Just look!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help you?	Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatcha looking at?	Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!	How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.	Good!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. A nice one, I hope.	Yes, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elbows, Son.	Sorry, Mom!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid you've got to.	I'll be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.	I just hope this is still good up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to go.	No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your bedroom?	No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --	Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hear that?!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Home sweet home!	To you maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To go up.	To go up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe I've just got the creeps.	How could you?! This is just like home!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!	Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?	I told you! I've got everything!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no.	What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.	Honey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there a problem?	No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.	What shall we call him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  I think it's just right.	And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!	If I...you know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch this!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, honey!	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calvin!	Coming!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the presents and do the lights.	You bet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?	And I made these!
<EOC>	<EOC>
One who doesn't glow in the dark.	Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's eat our cake.	Yeah. Let's dig in!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should we say a little prayer first?	Just open the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, yes it is!	"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's smart.	Yes, dear, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you bitching about now?	What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.	Your stuff?  Let me see that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.	Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it, you two!	I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!	I knew you'd like him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?	Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.	Oh, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me your hand.	Oh, my God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what do you think?	I think...it...works.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You hungry or thirsty, or both?	I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.	Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Here's to. An interesting experience.	I'll drink to that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's with Mike?	He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...	It's okay. Don't worry about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a Dairy Queen?	No way. I'm about to blow up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, be careful.	Okay, Sandy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I give you a kiss good night?	You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were late.	I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?	You want to go talk to him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to dance?	I can't dance fast.
Really?	Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.	Let's wait for some slow one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to dance?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God. What's wrong?	Frank!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father has a gun at home.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What are watchin' this junk for?	You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.	Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?	Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on out a minute, okay?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's ways around that.	Go find one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lord's name.	Mother Mary, full of grace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are ya ready?	Aye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck are you doing?	I-I'll tip her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What is it?	This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look again for fuck sake!	I know what the fuck he looks like!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	What?  What, that guy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys?	We're here brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Connor, is that you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.	What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No ma! No!	BLAME...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would someone please come over here and...	Fuck!

<EOC>	<EOC>
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.	Aye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No fuckin' hot water man. That...	Shut it. It's Ma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!	Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"""	"""I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Absolutely not.	No pictures, either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Destroy all that which is evil...	...so that which is good may flourish
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that right, Rambo?	All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nervous?	A bit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.	Just like on TV.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the fuck are you going?	We'll find it. Just calm down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who did you kill?	Holy shit. Who? How many?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you think?	I'm strangely comfortable with it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've teamed up with a sex offender.	So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He isn't to be touched.	He's a good man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.	Okay then... let's get ya started.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?	Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And number three, Dolly.	Uh... two shooters!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was in here when it went down.	Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.	Of course they were. How many?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The shooter knew these guys, huh?	How do you figure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Where's my cat?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!	You... oh god, why?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!	You killed my... my...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what are you thinkin' here?	Really want to know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the...	Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?	Sweet-n-low!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?	Why do you always disrespect me like that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many bodies, Greenly?	Eight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?	Shit! Shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god!	I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.	Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise me boys.	We promise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry the fuck up!	This is some crazy shit, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liberating isn't it?	Y'know it is, a bit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worst day of my life, man.	Well, I'm sold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.	What the fuck do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You bet your ass he will.	Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello? You there?	Y-Yes my son.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, I'll do you right here.	God have mercy on my soul.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.	What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.	How long since your last confession, my son?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?	Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.	Yeah boss?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see what I meant about the window?	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?	Would they do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's really kind of hot.	She's an attractive older woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's got a V-8, Dignan.	What do you think the cops have?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see that?	Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.	Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.	That sets it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It had an alarm.	Yeah, I heard that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?	Eight dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But he didn't say anything.	Hang on a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it back in?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Loop around real fast.	Just turn right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calm down. Take a deep breath.	You're right. You're right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the manager?	Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?	We know there's another stocker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that the manager?	Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	We got it. We got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.	Like he meant it.
Yeah.	Like he would find Dignan. One day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I get that credit card from you?	I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?	Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.	I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.	I keep it for emergencies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See if mine are in there.	Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.	Look at the treads on those.
What about them?	They obviously weren't designed for racing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll just say it.	I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.	On your marks...  Get set go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You owe me fifty bucks.	Bob?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.	Hi.
Inez, this is --	Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have a word with you, please?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's from Cuba.	No kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gone. He stole the car.	Where was it parked?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That coward. Son of a bitch.	Maybe he just went to the store.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He went back for his brother.	We said 48 hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you come with us.	OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe he just jumped you.	Can you hand me those french fries.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish I'd been there.	Would of been nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sixteen dollars.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had to give some to Inez.	How much?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When'd you get back?	Ah. Couple days ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's in the car?	That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What exactly is this place? Freezers?	Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time did he say to be here?	Right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could give somebody a concussion.	Let me feel that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	He seems pretty good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dignan. Take it easy.	Bob!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He doesn't want to fight.	Get out of the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.	Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, Dignan.	What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.	I'm sorry, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or I might end up with a broken nose.	Did that hurt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was a nice guy.	He was all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like Inez?	As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.	Yes. I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.	Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.	Roger.
We all set?	Hang on a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-huh?	Take your second position.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening? What's going on?	It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who did that? What the fuck is that?	It's going back down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Freeze!	Nobody move!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me move him.	Careful. Check his pulse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who tripped the alarm?	It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Let's go. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait for Kumar.	Come on, Kumar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding.	Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.	I'll see you there.
What?	I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?	I'll get him.
There's not enough time.	Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dignan, it's too late.	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like amnesia.	Can't remember shit. CRS.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	We're not sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're living on a sailboat?	It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?	Oh, I'd say about --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	Behind Bob's house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he in for?	He stole a tractor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is my business manager, Rowboat.	Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations. You passed the test.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a test?	Take a deep breath.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does that feel?	It feels good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did Dignan take the test?	Yes, he did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you're thieves. It's what you are.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're renegades from despair.	Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.	Why'd you want to help us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Future Man.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you grow cinnamon?	I don't know. Sure, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let them fight.	Let them fight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you serious?	Yeah. He said that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you.	See you, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.	What was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going?	Move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think he got my license plates?	He looked too shaken-up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Is that OK?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was Future Man adopted?	Jesus Christ! No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's not even talk about it.	It was stupid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give him a second.	Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, Bob.	I didn't do anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Who's got the car keys?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's in the driveway.	Temporarily.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you say nineteen?	Dies y nueve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you born in Mexico?	Cuba.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?	God, yes. Like silk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?  What?	Like silk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to meet you, Applejack.	You're Anthony?
Yeah.	I hear you're a good thief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.	Abdul-Shabazz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd they come from?	The front stairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that him?	Wait a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Anthony.	That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.	What's he doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Bob! Get back in position!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you a fag?	You're the faggot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what do you think?	I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not allowed to drive those.	Not even for emergencies?
No.	I thought your parents were in Italy.
They are.	So who's going to know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?	Good question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.	You're paranoid, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that all about?	I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?	I told you he's crazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd she go?	Maybe she turned.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we might of scared her.	Let's just go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I paid for it.	God DAMMIT.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.	That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?	Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much is there?	Don't count it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!	No. I was calm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bob, will you please listen?	I don't want to talk about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he chasing us?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bob. Are you coming?	See you in a little while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can go first, Bob.	My brother's in jail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dignan.	Anthony. Bad news.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?	Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?	Not a whole lot, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too bad about what happened on the road.	Yeah. It is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said 48 hours!	I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!	Bullshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on!	I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.	I didn't have any choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Bob.	That's OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's OK.	Look. We want you on the job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Bob.	I know it, man. Hang on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scarecrow?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with Applejack?	He's having a heart attack or something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he breathing?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?	I didn't think there was an alarm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The elevator broke.	Where's Applejack?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Applejack drove.	Run. Run. Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have your own room?	We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?	No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do they let you --	I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold on --	Here we go.
Wait a second --	Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that 700 bucks coming?	I'm working on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.	Yeah. Hey, Clay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing, Bob?	Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You keeping out of trouble?	I'm trying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long do you have to go?	26 weeks.
And what does that cover?	Social issues. Crime prevention.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ground defense.	Did you hear that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he in?	I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean grammar?	The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he good?	He's damn good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Join the party, fellas.	We're just going over a few things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the story?	Can't get it. It won't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're closed, sir.	Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.	Well, I left some money in there.
Where?	In the cash register. Step away from the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he? Where is Rob?	I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?	No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?	No, my friend knows her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like Chicanos?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You a good pool player.	Got a little lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	She is a good looking woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I'll get another Tecate.	Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?	Fight. You know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. Just pool.	You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.	No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the weather down there?	Mr. Henry?
Come on in!	It's locked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.	Good to know you, John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The world needs dreamers, son.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.	Pleasure to meet you, John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry to wake you.	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir...	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She say what time I should call?	The sooner the better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who else knows about this?	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...	Okay...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]	I speak English.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?	Yes...
That's not what happened to your parents.	Then what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.	You're a liar.
You know I'm not.	YOU'RE A LIAR!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to go now.	Is this really happening?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I emptied it.	Felt a little light.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Front. Use your teeth.	Sorry. Old habits.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	Conklin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You called it in?	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- car keys?	-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --	-- take the back -- get another car --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No... How?	The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.	We pushed it. We got lazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You drive.	What?
Switch! You drive!	-- where? -
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, too.	Tell me later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wanted to kill him.	But you found another choice.
I did.	It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know it's a dream.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See that tram coming around the corner?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No... Jason... please...	I was here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's me.	Bourne?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	I want to come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, shit...	Careful...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why am I alive?	Are you disappointed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need to get in there.	I'm working on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- go -- take the van! --	-- the hotel -- how far? --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright... take it down.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're sure?	What? The tapes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show me.	Here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is everything? Is there.	Is there. Is all there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Nevins?	Who's this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have you worked for the agency?	Me? Four years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it fresh?	It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's give him half an hour.	So?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything?	No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Young Robert, we are honored --	My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He won't come.	He will. I know he will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wallace has sacked York!	Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, M'lord.	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll wait... back there.	Hamish, I... thank...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.	Fourteen? --
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Bruce is not coming, William.	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stephen ready?	Aye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rest, William.	I rest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep these. We're going too.	No. One of us is enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wanna stay with me tonight?	I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.	Aye, we'll get 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll move	I will not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good to see you again.	I should'a remembered the eggs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must run in different directions!	We don't split up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have faced him. Have you?	Let her speak.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then when?	...Tonight!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am the Princess of Wales.	Wife of Edward, the king's son?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You will die! It will be awful!	Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come, it'll help you sleep.	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.	So what did you find.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.	Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.	Great. I'll see you soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Honey. What were you doing with that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There must be a way to fix this.	Fix?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just. Like. Jason.	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just tell me if anything weird happens.	Weirder than this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad lives here?	Not in this wing, actually. No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you stupid or what?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.	You really don't remember anything that happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?	He must be. They're letting him go, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.	Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.	Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where... where are my clothes?	Those are your clothes, silly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't understand, where are you taking me?	You'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.	Go on. Sit down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!	He's a fucking maniac!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just thought you should know.	Know what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's one major hole in your story.	Which is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!	Been there, done that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?	We'll find out soon enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just don't drop the ball, okay?	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smells like sex in here.	Thumper had a busy afternoon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can... can... Can I have this?	Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That should buy you ten minutes at least.	Gee, thanks friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I couldn't cut the rope.	Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, what'd you do that for?	Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!	What happened?? Where are we?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look what you made me do!	What's wrong with you?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lung cancer?	Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.	I think I'll go check out the chapel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lenny? Come on!	Oh my God oh my God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up, Tommy!	Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?	Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Monsieur Rick?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you get in here? You're under age.	I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.	My husband is with me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Monsieur Rick, I --	-- He's just a lucky guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.	What is your name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?	I'm sorry. It is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?	Yes, Monsieur.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you to take Miss Lund home.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you are.	It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's to you, sir.	Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.	Er, my check, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Er, goodbye, sir.	It has been a pleasure to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Mademoiselle?	You needn't be concerned about me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you get in?	The stairs from the street.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's been a long time.	Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.	Yes, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is Rick?	I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are very kind.	Won't you join us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This time they really mean to stop me.	Victor, I'm afraid for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I must find out what Berger knows.	Be careful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.	Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened with Rick?	We'll discuss it later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our faithful friend is still there.	Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ilsa, I --	-- Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful.	Of course, I'll be careful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready Ilsa?	Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Rick.	Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well then, perhaps you also ---	-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.	You're saying this only to make me go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do?	How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.	And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And I congratulate you.	What for?
Your work.	Thank you. I try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.	Not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll come again.	Any time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning.	Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening.	Good evening. You see, here we are again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, this might come in handy.	Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?	Yes, rather.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I understand.	Here it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My bill.	No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!	This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.	We'll be there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.	Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For the time being.	Good day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.	Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening, gentlemen.	Good evening, Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ho, diplomatist!	How about New York?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mademoiselle.	Mademoiselle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is the meaning of that phone call?	Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was a combination of all three.	And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.	Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.	Huh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, you were saying?	Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no, Rick never --	-- Thanks. I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.	Yeah? Why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?	Put it down as a gesture to love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you last night?	That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?	I never make plans that far ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me another.	Sacha, she's had enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --	-- Sacha, call a cab.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, we're going to get your coat.	Take your hands off me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Make it official, if you like.	What is your nationality?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!	Put it down!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.	Hello Ugarte.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rick! Rick, help me!	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boss!	Yeah?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?	Not right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she? Have you seen her?	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Save some for tomorrow.	Catch another fish tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get up.	Feels so good to lie here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If they can't see you, what's the point?	Survive today, that's the point.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're putting off the inevitable.	I'm putting it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get water!	Fix raft first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're beautiful.  Marry me.	You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm lost.  Goodbye.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's so damn funny?	You are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's real.	Nothing out there but ocean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't make it.	Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.	Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.	They're harder to do than they look.
Oh?  You've tried?	Well, I do a little drawing --
<EOC>	<EOC>
To tell you the truth -- you did.	Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.	Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep painting.  Promise me.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What brings you out to the sticks?	Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?	I had it on the island with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, a long one.	I've got lots of time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merry Christmas eve.	Not if you work for FedEx.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four four.  A record.	You don't seem too happy about it.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.	Let me guess, Russia came up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, for when you travel.	For when I travel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's your dog.	It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.	Yes there is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get back?  From where?	Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...	Hey...hey...it's okay!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right back, you said you'd be right back.	A few things came up.  Or went down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got married.	I thought you might have.
I would never --	I know.
If I'd known you were alive --	I would have done the same thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her name's Hannah.	Is that Jango?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that, written on the sail?	My epitaph.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Great.  Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Chuck.	You too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.	And how was your Christmas?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you say you are.	I most definitely say I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're Chuck Noland.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thought you were going to bring her.	So did I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to your pants?	Mom, meet Jango.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trying.	Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kamal is not here.	Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.	What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.	Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You what?	It was fifteen minutes late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't know we had sailboats.	It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I beat the odds!	You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about we go somewhere else?	Want to see my raft?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This stinks really bad.	You should have smelled me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool ropes.	I braided them.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.	Time I had lots of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were how long on this?	Forty-three days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To Wilson.	To Wilson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Digital laser readers.	Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.  For everything.	No sweat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only if you can afford it.	Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.	Life is waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!	You weren't dreaming about me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then I wasn't beautiful.	You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.	I doubt it. She's just an...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd she die of?	She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.	Good night, Daddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, Mrs...	Candy. Candy Kendall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many months are you?	Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I better go.	I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've seen only one movie? Which one?	"""King Kong"". It's really good."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.	Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.	Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I *know* this was right.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She won't go to St. Cloud's!	Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...	Mr. Rose *knows*?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?	We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi...	Hi...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.	Yes, I *have*!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So many children. Are they all orphans?	Well, this *is* an orphanage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wally thinks apples are boring.	I never said they were boring.
"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""	Well, they aren't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Wally.	I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!	He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.	*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought they might take me.	They wanted a girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her temperature is a hundred and four.	How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."""	Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just wanted to ask you...	Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is *your* father dead?	Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?	*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
But did you know him?	Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?	She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?	She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?	No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?	Someone not from Maine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh... it's the end of October.	Is that soon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you bite it?	I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.	Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.	I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder if you might give me a ride.	Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?	We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're migrants.	Migrants?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's almost like flying.	What about the trees?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.	This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm stayin', Homer.	Okay. Then you can be of use.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's obviously an aborticide.	Obviously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the name sheet?	Nobody's named this one yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.	"I'm not crazy about the ""Little..."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought it was my turn.	It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""One: Please don't smoke in bed."""	We heard that one already, Homer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rose Rose?	Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	It's just my heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like to read?	I can't read. Nobody taught me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.	No trouble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give men that. I know how to do it.	Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay, Rose?	I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's *it*?	That's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who cares?	Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.	Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No autonomic effects... that's correct.	When will he be home, Major?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They told me I was too old to serve.	They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?	Mind your own business, Peaches.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!	We see you next harvest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't this place look like home?	It look nicer then home!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.	That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.	You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you think you're going?	You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rose Rose has runned away!	She took off in the night!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?	He ain't never been outta Maine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.	Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can --	On me. For the seat. Cheers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?	What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We had to finalize the deal.	Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.	I know. It won't go unnoticed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.	The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?	Two million.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Grifters...	We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
It's all about the money, isn't it?	Isn't it always?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But there were other factors.	Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We were back on.	After you cut her loose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?	Today? Started off great...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten is standard, sir.	Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa. What?	We're going to give him the money back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The red hair... It's bad luck.	It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jake...	It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going home	Let's go, Jake?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moonan. Here. Shit...	So what? We just stay clear of him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	I told you, use less powder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what we're doing with the money.	And what about Big Al?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	Tonight. Just me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta be kidding me. Her?	Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much we going after?	Two million.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.	"No, not ""whatever."" You're either in or you're out."
<EOC>	<EOC>
She up for this?	She's up for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be there?	Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?	We'll use the Euc.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So that's it...	That's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?	What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	I said take off your fucking shirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come here. Feel this.	No thanks. I'm good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. Harder.	I think I just broke my hand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.	Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?	Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What -- What do we do?	Help me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this? You guys cops or something?	We're not cops.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not --	You interested in a little work?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  What's my cut?	You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?	Just play a part. A little acting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's his problem?	Don't worry about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gone.	Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.	Don't ruin this for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you deal with --	WHAT?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about...	What about what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry. I didn't know...	Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"You tell them the ""Tale""."	What do you want? An apology?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop waving that thing around.	You sure we're clear?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	You better get over to Al's. Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're working for the King.	Wait a second... Who's the mope?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Him.	You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...	Where the hell is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And we got rid of the red head.	Jake? Customs?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.	You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up with you? Bladder infection?	Keep it up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I speak to you in confidence?	Huh? Oh. She's alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten percent.	You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The King, huh? Nice going.	I try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys awake?	We're here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	High five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Bella.	Jack Manfred.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.	Is it that bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack. Do you need a ride?	No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.	Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're shaking.	It's the tension.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate cheats.	All men are cheats.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of deal you looking to?	What's the Blue Book price?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about fifteen hundred?	How about five hundred.
What?!	How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?	I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Eight-fifty.	Seven-fifty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought it was you. It's the hair!	I'm working on that soccer story.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.	Habib?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.	South African women are very sporty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found her in bed with someone.	Who was he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't gamble.	Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Last hand.	Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I get it.	Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I couldn't resist them.	You mean I won't resist them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are a beautiful woman.	It's not just inner beauty, is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're my prisoner.	I've got something to tell you.
I want to hear it.	I've got a job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you trying to read my palm?	You've got such beautiful hands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the time?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did it go?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're shaking. What is it?	Tension. It'll go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I loved it blond.	It's only hair. I haven't changed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're my conscience.	Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The door, Jack.	Leave it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's beautiful. Thank you.	I hope it brings you luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.	You will?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You were talking in your sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.	There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.	Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.	Then what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here...use a spoon.	Leave me alone, Marion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you take the money?	I hate public transport.
What?	I want to buy a car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've lived there.	Well, thank you anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you hurt your hand?	Just an accident. Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He doesn't gamble.	I'll watch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which side do you like?	You choose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Next time it'll be my neck.	What about my neck?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you to forget what I said.	Wait a minute...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much do you owe?	Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?	I told you, all bets are off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it yes?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And your hand too.	I took the bandage off yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like a drink?	No thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?	Too much. Eighteen hundred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where to?	Turn left at the lights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you live, Jack?	Over the river.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Bella come here?	That bitch? No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Jack, join us.	No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!	I don't gamble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't give you a lift back tonight.	Don't worry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rough day?	Rough life, Jack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to Bella?	I'll tell you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.	Jack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you go to school?	I was at Beadles.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you take a break, Jack.	All right, Mr Reynolds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's paying out in stacks of 25.	I can see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the information.	A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel, Jack?	Bruised.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.	Right, that checks out here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.	I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.	Look, bomb...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he doin'?	I think he's talking to it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The key, goddamit, the key!	Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?	We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It didn't go off.	Oh, God...
It didn't go off.	Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to disarm the bomb.	Doolittle, are you there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell?	Yoo hoo, bomb...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quantum is up thirty-five.	I read the same here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rechannel all safety relays --	-- open quantum latches --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, bomb...	And I saw that I was alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, bomb, are you with me?	Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?	I am always receptive to suggestions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.	I'll check it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you gonna name it?	What?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?	Who cares. Don't bother me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Commander Powell would have named it.	Commander Powell is dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.	Fred.
Wha?	I hereby name this star Fred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.	Ah, negative drop.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Doolittle! Help me.	Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yeah?	Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Men... men... what happened, men?	Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?	Yeah.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man, you got a bad attitude.	I like to keep it professional, that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing happened between me and Tia.	Leave.  Now.
Can I say something in my defense?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Move it.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're ya doin', Max.	You mean until you showed up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Police drone.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Out there.	No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I'm afraid of--	Don't look down.

You're light a deuce.	Am I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!	SHHH!  Don't do that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sophy?  Are you okay?	Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.	When?
Soon, baby.	Mommy, I'm scared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a thief?	Girl's gotta make a living.
Thank God.	First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.	Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--	Logan Cale.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry about your window.	Can we go somewhere and talk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme get my coat.	The one you're wearing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.	It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.	The other ones?
The other one like you...	You lost me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you're back and still rocking the boat.	Somebody's got to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Open it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm looking for a lady who works here.	Ladies would be elsewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not a place you wanna go.	Let go of my hand.

"Say the words, ""I understand."""	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.	Got a pencil?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.	One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's odd...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gotta go.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you put that in a bag or something?	You get it when I get her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?	You're the best, Maxie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Catch you back at the wall.	Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?	I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.	But I'll take a rain check...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sketchy--	We gotta talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You love him?	I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?	More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?	He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No problem.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to take this slow...	Right, slow...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you, high?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?	Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.	What's in Sandusky?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Could be.	And if it ain't cleaned off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jam, listen up.	Hawk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.	They're what?

<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.	Why is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I'm going home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're moving through time.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.	Maybe she's asleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? How long was I asleep?	The whole movie. Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you please talk to me?	Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come with me.	Where are we going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that a cellar door?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're such a fuck-ass.	When did you stop taking your medication?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Grandma Death.	That is a terrible nickname.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, shit!	Grandma Death.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're my only son...	I know, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is Frank?	A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cellar door.	Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, I met a new friend.	Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.	Frank.
I think he saved my life.	How so?
Don't you watch the news?	I don't own a television.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is going to happen?	Frank is going to kill.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.	Congratulations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much are they paying you to be here?	Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Gerald.	Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our son just called me a bitch.	You're not a bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	Donnie? You're a dick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?	That's enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ. Is that an axe?	Yep.
How did this happen?	I guess they made him do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye mom.	We was robbed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate her!	We all do. Now let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, I didn't get any.	Here, have some.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Father...	Take a letter...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?	Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?	I wanna powder my nose...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey you!!	All right -
<EOC>	<EOC>

Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.	That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!	I didn't come here to be insulted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Merrick, sugar?	Yes please, two.
One or two?	Two, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And here is one of Frederick's mother.	How lovely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They have noble faces.	I've always thought that myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You won't be long?	I'll join you shortly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John loves the house.	Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	And here are my mother and father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stay with me.	Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.	Yes?
I found it.	Did you see it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our man is sick. Come right away.	What is it?
Like this.	I'll get my bag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	I'll show you! I'll show you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't!	Shut up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	He fell.  He falls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I think we really do understand one another.	Right... Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Treves.	Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?	It's quite nutritious, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.	Indeed!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yes?	And what was that, John?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you imagine what his life has been like?	Yes, I think I can.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long has this man been here?	Three quarters of an hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.	What a mess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I say Freddie, what are you about?	Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's very pretty, your mother.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you read it?	No, but I certainly shall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You alright?	y-y-yes--
Want to come out?	You're English.
Of course! You want out?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.	Good morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll have to find some more.	Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.	Yes John!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening. How are you feeling?	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This... is my new home?	Yes.
The hospital?	Of course! What did you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look splendid, John.	Thank you very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Children. Where are your children	Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you... would you like to see my mother?	Your mother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, John.	Good morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a dressing bag, John?	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...my... home?	Yes, John.
You did this for me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My home.	There is one more thing, John. Here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it the one you wanted?	Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.	Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Treves! Treves.	John.... how can you ever forgive me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stand up, John. Let them see you.	Oh no, I couldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight John. Sleep well.	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The workhouse.	Yes! The workhouse!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Won't come out, eh?	No, he's very upset about something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?	I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Open up! I know you're in there!	Ah! It's my father!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right! Where is he?	Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!	There IS no one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... where is he?	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!	You're losing your temper!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right! It isn't happening!	But, Father, it IS!
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHAT did you say?	I said welcome.
WELCOME?	Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"How d'you KNOW we're ""friends""?"	Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?
Those things in your hands.	These? What are THESE? They're swords.
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHY?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.	"""The fifth one this week""!"
Oh, for goodness' sake!	And I thought you said it was something special...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We mustn't let him land!	Who?
Halfdan the Black.	But, Erik...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just give me a hand.	I mean, you could have killed yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the Cloak Invisible?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The second note.	The second note to wake the Gods...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Erik! You've done what you came to do!	Not quite...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then I shall come too.	No... no...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.	But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
<EOC>	<EOC>
But --	It was my master Keitel's idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do we know this is the way?	We blew the Horn Resounding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see, Erik?	I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?	It is day, of course, Freya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there nothing men can do?	The Gods are asleep, Erik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And will the dead ever return, Freya?	That I cannot tell you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How?	Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.	Well... isn't it great?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're just not a very musical nation...	No, no... It was very... er, nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll tell you what...	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.	You've got to let me go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But it IS! Look!	The important thing is not to panic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scream.	Ah.
Louder.	Aaagh! Rape!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You told them I raped you -- why?	I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?	Why... should YOU care?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?	Well... no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is THAT Odin?	You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why should you care?	I don't know! I just did!
<EOC>	<EOC>
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?	Find it... AND cross it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""But"" what?"	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	Come on, move it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Halfdan the Black!	I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Erik! Row! What are you doing?	It saved my father!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How deep IS the ocean?	Very deep... usually...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's hack her to pieces.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's terrible!	You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Halfdan the Black's here!	I know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!	I know. I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not magic! It's just a trick!	Don't you FEEL it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... I... KILLED her...	That's my boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to die...  No, I don't!	Row! Row! Row!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Slower! In... Out...	Sorry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faster!	Make your mind up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are YOU doing here?	You may need a real Berserk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.	Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SHUT UP!	ROW!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, the sky is blue...	The sun! That's it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's magic.	"What ""magic""?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
"What ""magic"" have you brought, Erik?"	You'll see!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he say?	Look out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!	Well, come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A magic dishcloth.	To the oars!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weren't we supposed to?	Oh... I feel a little... oh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! Let go, Snorri!	I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!	No! Arrgh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is another way.	Who gets killed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You need to say a bit more than that!	Oh... er... yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter with them?	Just say something cheerful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait, Erik!	Keitel Blacksmith?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.	What's the matter with Bjorn?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	But how could he know... unless...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what else do we do?	How about making friends?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about, Erik?	What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.	What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.	We'd be the first!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you two! What's going on?	I was sitting there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I AM one, Dad!	We haven't got a spare place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ROW!	DEATH!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She hasn't got any.	She MUST have a knife or something...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hy-Brasil?	Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sven!	Let me do something for myself for a change!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I came to find my grandfather.	I have to go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, Leif.	Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...	You will wait?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's all the panic about?	The Dragon...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It can't do you any HARM...	What do we have to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did he do that?	Do what?
Vanish into thin air?	He hasn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He used to puke in his sleep.	Bastard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!	Mum! Dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aaagh!	Got you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well! Come on!	I... I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.	What have you got there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wasn't it, Keitel?	Well... I... I thought...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?	How can we stops him now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sh! Hurry!	YOU do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't swim! I can't swim!	Relax!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!	Help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help!	Help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should have got rid of you long ago!	Like you got rid of Snorri!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!	Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!	It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
<EOC>	<EOC>
KILL! KILL!	Stop it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
HOLD it! HOLD it in!	DEATH TO DRAGONS!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, of course he is!	Sh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.	I'm just building up to it, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, go on! Go berserk!	GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is nothing we can do...	Helpless...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!	You liar!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well I'M certainly not, either.	Neither am I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... I'm game.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up.	Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thorfinn! You can't die!	I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!	No... he's not... not... there...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, guys.	I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Yeah.	Say hi to Naomi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was the girl you walked off with?	No one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, it was lovely.	Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ms. Kruczynski?	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	Why?
Why what?	Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.	Well, I wouldn't want to be --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like that?	Very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready for another?	No, I'm okay for now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I should probably get going.	No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
No. I --	I know a man who needs a refill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo ho ho!	It's three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me drive you home.	Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can you watch this crap?	Where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	I don't want to talk about this here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, um --	Would you get me another, Joely?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're drunk.	You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
<EOC>	<EOC>
More?	No. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joely...	Yeah, Tangerine?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if you hide me?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy Birthday.	Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I scoured the city for it.	I love it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right. Something black though.	I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.	I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.	But you weren't. I could tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I dropped you off after. You said --	Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.	Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told her today I need to end it.	Is that what you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi there.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what I did.	Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, how horrid.	I'm Joel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.	I know.
What do we do?	Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish we did. You married?	Um, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do sort of live with somebody though.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Male or female?	Female.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool.	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, Joel.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you'll call me, right?	Yeah.
When?	Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. What if it breaks?	What if?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I should go back.	Joel, come here. Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's true.	I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.	I'm like a joke to them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's them.	It's too late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should maybe talk to you.	Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clementine.	That's your look for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yours?	You take it. I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
How was it?	You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.	Go back to sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you don't mind?	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!	I hope you get your work done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, hey, Patrick.	Hi, Mary. How's it going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?	Nah, I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Definitely!	I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boo.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stan... c'mon...	Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...	I know. Anyway --
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's freezing out.	You found us okay?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?	We haven't checked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yup.	Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let him go, Stan. I can help.	Go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's stopped.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's coming?	You better go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.	Hi.
What do you want, Stan?	Can I... I brought some --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howard, your one o'clock.	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary...	Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?	Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.	Welcome, Howard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary. What are you doing here?	She came to help, Howard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tried that already.	Did you try going through C-Gate?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howard, they've disappeared again.	Oh dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, I've got to drop the van off.	Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The voltage looks fine.	Then check the connections.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does that help?	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your bartlett's?	It's a quote book.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I don't know how to polka.	Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	Clockworks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you believe in then?	Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I guess not.	'Drugged' is a stupid word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does she like what in bed?	Like what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm cold.	Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Going north?	You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	American Cheese. The king of road food.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That means top-secret, Cooper.	I heard it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can see why they sent you along.	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit...	Justin?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time to play Spam in the can.	Don't start with me, Cooper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have a man down...	Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...	Hold on, Coop...
<EOC>	<EOC>
But Justin...	I'll get him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.	On my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...	Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?	What?
Coffee.	No, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that an offer?	It is not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	I don't know, the screens are dead...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me breathe, let me breathe...	You're okay now, it's over...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.	Hurry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...?	Run!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...	Trauma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll live... if we ever make it back.	We'll make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...	Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Please... kill...	Oh God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing. It's nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening...?	A power drain --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got a pulse, he's alive...	Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .	He's crashing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god OH MY GOD...	Starck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...	That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.	Start the countdown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Justin, finish your sweep.	Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Patch me through to him.	Justin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus its huge.	Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can see the hatch.	Starck, you still showing those readings?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...	There's no one here, Skipper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. I'm on the bridge.	What you got, Peters?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found one.	Alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...	...how's the client?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can anybody hear me...	Skipper...
Peters...	...you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a negative, Starck.	Justin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does it say?	NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any survivors?	Negative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No one?	They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you... She won't let you leave...	Son of a bitch!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weir is dead.	Then who the fuck are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't have them. Go to hell.	NOOO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	What is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heading three-three-four...	...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got some weather.	I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
<EOC>	<EOC>
1500 meters. We're getting too close...	Where is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is now.  We're locked in.	Starck, give me a read.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain Miller...	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But...	You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Skipper...	What is it, Smith?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smith, get out of there...	Come again, Skipper?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it, where is it...	Smith? Smith! Fuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?	I just finished drying...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.	Come around to three-three-four...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.	Radiation interference?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's an affirmative.	Keep your eyes open.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everybody okay?	We're all here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It tastes bad.	But you can breathe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miller, come in...	What's going on in there, Starck?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weir can't be alive.	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.	Blow it up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do it --	No. I'll be right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...	...repeat, we're armed...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weir.	He's dead...
<EOC>	<EOC>
First time in a grav couch?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claire...	DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's another one. They're all over the place.	They're explosive charges.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. I saw nothing.	I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no one in the corridor but us.	Not according to the computer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's engaged the override.	Can you shut it down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.	Keep him talking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Almost got it.	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got any coffee?	It's cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she?	Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...	She's not ugly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The safety circuit's failed!	We're losing atmosphere...
<EOC>	<EOC>
30 hours to Neptune orbit.	All boards are green, everything's five by five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't do that.	The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
<EOC>	<EOC>
If they are, they're screening their calls.	Range 3000 meters and closing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...	Picking up magnetic interference.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to his eyes?	Explosive decompression.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miller, do you read me, Peters --	Get them back --
<EOC>	<EOC>
A straight line.	Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Ship's log.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	It wants me. I have to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	The forward airlock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you know it was me?	I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not really dressed for a party.	Relax, it's casual.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look like an eighties rock band.	The suit will stretch. You should try it --
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is Reed?	Victor must've taken him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ben, come in.	What is this? Where's Reed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it. Everything I want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't take this.	Ben. This is business. Just work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.	I'm sure he's matured since then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The shields on the station should protect us.	Should?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.	Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the --!	Ben. Are you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where... where am I?	Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?	They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! That's a prototype!	Go back to the drawing board.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...	That's terrible news...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me like-y.	Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.	Last one down springs for room service.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're on fire!	Not this again --
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not responsive --	Ben! Ben!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what is up with that?	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!	Ben, are you there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.	Oh, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back it down, Johnny!	I can go hotter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.	But all these people...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Apparently I can disappear.	Please tell me you go silent too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --	Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it.	"Okay, ""mom."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that thing?	I think that thing is Ben.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm driving.	Dude. That's my sister.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two need a time-out.	Blockhead started it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing --	Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're ready for you, sir.	Showtime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--	Never better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, Sue...? I can't.	What? What do you mean you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	We need to get past them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.	What...?  Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reed. How close are we to a cure?	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found a broken gasket, from space --	A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?	Hilarious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Ben, come on...	Reed, we're running out of time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?	I understand the business reasons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Raising the shields.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Victor, are you feeling alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just find him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?	Arnold. What's happening?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?	Of course.
How much did they cost?	Don't worry about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead. Just make it quick.	Totally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't find it, mon!	It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?	First door on your left!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy, mon.	Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Brad.	Sis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?	Why?
I don't know. I was just curious.	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!	I didn't say that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you still a virgin?	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Mom know you have company?	It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going to tell me, are you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?	They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.	But they weren't mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad says you have to get up!	Ugh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave me alone!	Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.	Dad says!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to meet you, Stacy.	Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any ice tea?	Sure. Come on in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to take a quick swim?	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pick a suit.	I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you really a virgin?	Come on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a really good kisser.	So are you.  Are you shaking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?	You first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mike?	What? Are you all right?
I think we're making a lot of noise.	I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you call me up tonight?	Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take that back.	All right, I take it back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Rat.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?	All right. Pay attention.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damone, are you there?	I'm really pretty busy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I've gotta be running.	Okay. See ya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor guy.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. I don't think so. Not right now.	Chicken!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're losing it, Damone.	You're crazy. Those girls love me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you Linda Barrett?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	That's me, Merv.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going to ride that wave?	Totally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.	I thought he was out of town.
He is.	Then don't hassle it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seen the new Playboy?	Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck is this guy doing?	This ain't no cop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!	They're fuckin' with us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My brother's car!	All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going.	Do you think that guy's cute?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.	Believe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just kidding. About 10cc.	Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	I think they're both virgins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, he hardly even talks anymore.	I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Spicoli?	That's the name they gave me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just ripped my card in two!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr... Mr. Hand.	That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?	I don't know. I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.	All right! Oh, yeah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aloha, Mr. Hand!	Aloha, Spicoli.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can I get for you tonight.	How about your phone number?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for picking me up.	No problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a nice shirt.	Thanks. Thanks a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you really nineteen?	Yes... I am really nineteen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I better take you home.	What about those other guys you live with?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this your first time?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your other question?	My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for coming to get me.	Sure thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is a nice car.	Yeah. It's my sister's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have Mrs. George for English?	Yeah. She is pretty good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what you want?	I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Oh yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.	Two more Cokes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So... pretty nice house you've got here.	Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I've got to go home.	Do you really have to go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Mark.	Hi, Stacy. How are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's have lunch!	Righto!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!	Not where we operate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Naked!?	Naked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God!...	This is my granddaughter...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...and we're chock full of that!	Damn right!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the medicine?	The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shoot it.	Not yet. I want to study its habits.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Why what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When does this thing stop?	It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.	You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah... I thought we might need it...	What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want that fucking radio!	Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.	They were all veterans.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The airport is over there!	Never missed a plane yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What made you do it? Who paid you off?	Nobody. I'm the maid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I see your license.	Of course, officer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could I have that, please?	Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!	You and a lot of other people.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.	Spare me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop!	What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!	They'll get in! We'll all die!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Careful.	I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I will not die because of him!	Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know where it is?	Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you two going?	We're going to get my little girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.	Where is everyone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
IS IT CLEAR?!	Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?	Nah, I got the gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it don't look pretty.	But it's got teeth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think you should...	With what just happened upstairs --
<EOC>	<EOC>
We shot a skunk.	We're lucky to be alive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! Get quiet or get out.	C'mon guys--
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I know where a CB is.	Where's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.	Come on, come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!	"""OH!?"" WHAT IS ""OH?"" What does ""oh"" mean?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wha?	OPEN THE DOOR!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And that's how I ended up here.	And the head?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're right here.	Hey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.	Easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all sure about this?	Follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the tunnel?	In the corner, behind the curtain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We just smeared a skunk.	Shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scared?	No. You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohhh.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?	Just an observation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what now? Did those things leave?	Why don't you go check it out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any more ideas Animal Planet?	You weren't helpin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're better off.	Who's with me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on!	He's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now, Geronimo?	My truck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm in.	Anyone else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to get help.	We gotta try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gotta be close.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.	Just cover me. It was built to move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you holding up?	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Push and twist, it's child proof.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doesn't your foot hurt?	I can't feel a thing, Hon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Um-hmmm.	The girl's got rhythm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanna see, baby?	Sure.
How much you got?	How much I got, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My husband...	Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the kitchen, under the sink.	No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	What?
What do you mean what?	Huh?
What's going on between you two?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?	Get outta here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.	Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.	I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome back.	F-f-fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They were all over the place.	You smell like ass!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bullshit.	No bullshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clever fuckers.	What the hell's going on here!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blow the goddamn hatch!	Clear!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got 'cha!	HOLD THAT TIGHT!
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Eh, Chief?	Duh hickey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine, Chief.	Gimme the keys.
NO, but I will lock you in.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Move slow and move quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Move it!	You keep that key handy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!	I'm fine! I'm fine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!	If he doesn't shut up...
<EOC>	<EOC>
SHIT.	MOVE YOUR ASS!
<EOC>	<EOC>
COME ON!	HELLLLLLLLP!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, maybe.	Get something on that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
HELP MEEE!	BONSAI!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.	Amazing you made it this far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
OH JESUS!	HELLLPPP!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I'll go.	Ok. Let's see what happens.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing, just lookin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	She's not very nice, is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
DON'T!	YOU'LL HIT US!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's wait it out.	They'll tear this place down within the hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.	That's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold it!	Whoa!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go!	Wait God-dammit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go! Go!	Not without you!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get to your cars!	GO-GO-GO!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God... What is that?	That's one piece of four problems.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know you don't have to do this.	I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.	We all have to be strong, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should stick together out there.	I'd love to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did we make it?	I think --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?	Um, well...
Are you lying to me?	Well...
What did we say about lying?	I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?	I said I'm not lying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?	I just hit it like you said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.	You see: We've got to change that name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Frances, got a minute?	Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good, good. Give them that.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madam...?	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, but come here first.	Huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Harold.	Frances.
Where's Clifford?	He's not here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harry!	I gotta go now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're all square now, Harry. Right?	All square, Doc.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you an alcoholic?	No.
Were you a drug addict?	No. Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, baby.	See you next weekend, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's already started, Dad... with me.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do, Dad?	You really want to go?
Of course.	And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.	...Then go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.	Be careful, Francie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you... are you hungry?	I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bread?	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you ever going back?	...Not if I can help it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.	They'll mend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?	Why, you... you little bastard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How ya doin', Farmer?	Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Serious, huh?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't start, Farmer.	It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The chauffeur. He's watching.	He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take a walk, pal.	Who said I was a lady?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God, I look awful.	You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's just one more thing.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyway... if you need me...	I got your number, Mister Man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frances! Frances!	Who?
Frances, it's me, Harry?	...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Harry. I love you.	I love you too, Frances.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where to?	Oh Harry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mere. I want to talk to you.	Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How... how ya doin', Farmer?	Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.	How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.	Well... you're looking well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty morning.	It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
And no people.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	What'd you do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!	Run!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?	'Golden Boy.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it sound?	The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?	You got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay.	Smile, little sister, smile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, who have we here...?	Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I need a little air.	What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.	Where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long will you be?	Not long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll have lunch ready by one.	I'll be back.
At one. Promise?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say you promise.	I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't... talk crazy.	Mama...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there something else?	You didn't say 'Symington says'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Symington says...	Sedate her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were with him at the end.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice.	The music? Or the fire?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're an outcast.	Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?	Yes. Very close
<EOC>	<EOC>
Soon?	Yes. I want this over and done with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why... her?	Her body pleases me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You will honor your promise to me!	I will not! Kill me now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's beautiful.	She's not for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor William! What indignant tears!	There, there... shhh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!	Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You dance so beautifully together.	And you look so lovely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't cry, Elizabeth.	Aren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure it can't hurt us?	Nothing can. Not ever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!	The world is a dizzying place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've loved you all my life	All my life I've known.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This feels... incestuous.	Is that what makes it so delicious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You make me weak.	Not as weak as I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our decision. Together.	Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...	...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Victor. I love you,	Elizabeth. My more than sister.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought I'd never see you again!	I'm all right. I'm safe,
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brother and sister no more.	Now husband and wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victor!	Open this door for no-one!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's going to ram us.	It wouldn't dare.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor?	Oh God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was just clearing my throat.	Very well then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am not mad.	As a march hare.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Henry Clerval.	Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only you would think of that!	Somebody has to!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.	Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened up there?	I didn't find what I was looking for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paracelsus?	Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?	Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Re-configure the leads?	Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.	The strain was evident.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you share my madness?	Madness?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The killer is still out there.	I will protect you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should go now.	Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you see?	I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.	Tomorrow is another day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Melvin Belli.	I was careless.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Alice.	Good night, Brenda.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any particular reason?	Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?	I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Next Friday.	Thanks, Alice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steve said for you to start on the boats.	I finished the boats.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?	Un-hunh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God...	You okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Filmmaker.	Artist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'll you do when you leave here?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How the... did he get in there?	Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.	Not if they're where I think they are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help you clean up?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't hear it anymore.	Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.	I'll go take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	They're off now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go check on Brenda.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack?	Marcie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's dead. Try the pay phone.	Do you have a dime? A quarter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter with it?	Wet. I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come?	Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said we were special.	I meant everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what I said, though.	I can't, Barry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wouldn't know.	Oh, you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claudette...	Somebody'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody's there, Barry.	Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...	I need you so much, Claudette.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell?	Where'd you get that stuff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me a hand?	For sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be okay. Holy shit...	Don't get up. Take a second...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.	A short somewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Is it stuck?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roll him over!	Get behind him more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chance to get even?	I'll spot you five points.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just had some lucky shots.	Where's Ned?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What hath God wrought?	That was the telephone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ha!	Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack?	Coach, athletic director somewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about our last jay?	Good call.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just a dream.	I call it my shower dream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you wet?	Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmmmmmph?	Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...	Umhummmmph.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.	Whassamatta?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.	There you are dead wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cowboy.	Girls can't be cowboys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Last line of Gone With the Wind?	Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Those things can be nasty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have to drop you here, Steve.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck.	Another coincidence.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many with you?	Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?	Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.	I meant me, my son and my daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want to stop?	I'm exhausted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this guy's problem?	I have no idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you gonna do?	I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Jacob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are the keys to the motor home?	On the dresser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then?	Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.

Who else?	Pass.
Why not, against your religion?	No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Where are you taking us?
Mexico.	What's in Mexico?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to go back for Daddy!	Daddy's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch my back!	Anytime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many bullets left, kid?	Not many.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See ya.	Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you giving that pig signals?	What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He says you were scratching.	I wasn't scratching!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck was that about?	He signaled the Ranger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Start the car.	You believe me don't cha?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it feel?	How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the woman?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Richard!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?	This ain't the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what you think?	That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?	That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?	No, Richie, what do I look like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you?	Scarred for life, that's how I am!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it.	"Who signed as his ""sponsoring officer""?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow...	What'd you find, Kathy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then good night.	So I'll get a fair shot?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --	Educate her, Pyro.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?	Wasn't deemed a threat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it.	Show us where you are, Chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>

What's with the chewing gum?	Makes us look more American.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.	You were right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we should leave now.	Good idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd they say?	I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.

Who the hell are you?	It's okay. I know her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	It's Raymond.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is it?	Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.	Open.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You WILL go out there.	I won't and nothing you say-
"""The show must go on."""	...Damn you!  Damn you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, what an ass.	COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
<EOC>	<EOC>
At ease men.	Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
<EOC>	<EOC>
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!	DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.	Must be some sort of mining facility.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead!	You go first! There's no time!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?  What?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?	Yes. Good was done this .....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not again...	I played Richard III...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is going on?!!?	Jason, what have you gotten us into?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happened?	The engines are dead. We're drifting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And note the sucked in gut.	...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's a miserable twit!	The guy is terminally selfish!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...	Dear God.... How did I come to this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex you can't -just leave.	Oh can't I? Watch me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.	Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.	You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.	I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god, It's real.	All this from watching the.. historical records?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We heard it the first time!	Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I get the check?	The ships are gaining...
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Go into the cloud! ..."	Alex? Where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Nobody was WATCHING?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?	Down there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes...?	Okay, that's where you want to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, wait, are you-	Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!	GO Commander.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go. They're off again.	Up.
What?  Up?	Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Structural damage at 68 percent.	We're getting major structural damage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The ship is sustaining structural damage.	Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The enemy is matching velocity.	The enemy is matching velocity.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.	We need another one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.	No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Systems register functional.	All systems are working, Commander.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A hologram...	Never mind, Fred....
<EOC>	<EOC>
As good as Hopkins?	Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Crewman #6""... Call me Guy."	You... know us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
THAT'S why you built this ship?	It's ... incredible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are the miners?	Something BAD happened here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Okay	All right. Put me back on with him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?	No. Keep all energy to the armor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi everybody.	Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More to the left... Stay parallel...	Hey, YOU want to drive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Assault on Voltareck III.""  Episode... 31 I think."	We're doing episode 31?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're gone.	Where'd they go? Back inside?
<EOC>	<EOC>
~e're alive!	We made it. Commander, we made it.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You smiled at me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.	Let me think. I need time to think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.	I don't think that's a cloud...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can it be repaired?	Computer, can it be repaired?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?	Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're playing your good side.	Don't be ridiculous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does the rolling help, actually?	It helps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clenched jaw...	Will you stop RIDING ME?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jason.. Can you hear me?	Yes. Yes, I'm here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?  What did he say?	Nothing. Hold please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!	Wait... Jason, Here!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's accelerating to Mark 6.	Mark 12.
<EOC>	<EOC>
never doubted you for a second.	TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding. When for?	Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unbelievable.	You are so full of shit
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta admit, they do love him.	Almost as much as he loves himself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it, It's go time.	Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Explain -	Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Commander?... Where are you... going?	Home.
You... You mean Earth?	"Yeah. ""Earth."" Time to get back to ""Earth,"" kids."
<EOC>	<EOC>
An interstellar vox.	Thanks
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weapons storage...	It's perfectly safe. I promise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?	NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?	Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Former Commander?	I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.	You what?.. What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Deception..."" ""Lies."""	Well... Sort of...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	I think we're going to exit the space port.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!	It's as far as it goes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could be this.	Push It. Hold it down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do your best, Tommy...	Oh god...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, right, sorry.	Okay, let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry Guys... It just went off.	Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay... On what?	How about the pig-lizard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-	It doesn't have eyes.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.	It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pedal to the metal Tommy...	Pedal to the metal...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's do it, Tommy.	Commander?... Call me Laredo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Continue forward, sir?	Patience, Lt. . Patience.
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHAT? WH	Because they're coming right at us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some say that Hessians are invincible.	They always say that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, George, who were you?	I?  You all know my history.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.	While they're strung out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Misunderstood what!?	A lot of years have gone by.
What?  What are you talking about?	That you would have known you can trust me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me?  You apologizing to me?	Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is that!?	That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going to keep him, sir?	We better, Congress invented him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.	Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Partially...	It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.	If he isn't, then he's stupid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colonel Reed...	George!  So good to be back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!	General Lee, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not today.	I want you to see our hospital.
<EOC>	<EOC>
General Greene?	I'm with Captain Hamilton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, this must be about something!	It is; we need you George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?	It's stupid, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.	Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get the money?	No. What's this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trade for what?	The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get life for kidnapping.	Calm down, Bear...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I pulled my quadriceps.	So... how many movies you been in?
About sixty.	No shit? What're some of 'em?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is my nephew?	Your who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this movie you're doing first?	Harry, let me answer that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karen? You okay?	She can't talk right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know Laurel Canyon?	I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.	Gimme an hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Karen?	In the can. That the money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.	You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	It's not the kind of thing you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C-18.	That's the magic number.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?	That's correct. Look at me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the fuck are you?	Ray Barboni. From Miami.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You live in Miami?	That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?	I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?	I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?	Not yet. I just started.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?	Harry, lemme give you some advice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A marker's like a check, Harry.	I know what a marker is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep going.	Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?	Hey, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's your keys, Harry.	Get the fuck outta my chair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. That was a good party.	You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
At that point, basically, that has to be it.	You're not going to tell me the rest?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.	Buddy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatta you think, Chill?	That's not bad. I think you got it down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The door from the patio, in back.	You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.	What if it was?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You been here the whole time?	I just caught the end.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harry... My God...	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be right back.	Go get your stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What took you so long?	Couldn't find my toothbrush.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?	That's what the guy said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you not to -	Don't say a fuckin' word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah? What three words, Harry?	Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?	You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Doris.	Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.	You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.	Murray's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Be quiet and listen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.	Harry -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harry, we spoke with Martin.	'We?'
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karen. Wow. Look at you...	Hello, Martin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.	I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.	With that coxswain dickhead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about now?	Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?	That's what it says.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What day is it?	I don't know. Tuesday?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One more?	Why not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is your first name?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maureen.	What?
Maureen.	Maureen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roger.	Roger?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think that's funny	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Bring it on, dude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.	Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Last thing we want is extra partners.	Or uninvited guests.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This's gonna hurt a little.	Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I'll just keep working.	What're you crazy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe that is his boat.	Gimme a break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.	Maybe he isn't alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smokes?	Oh yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Try Wednesday.	Right. Wednesday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you?	Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dodge.  Dodge.	What?
Get up.	Yeah, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?	Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother fucker!	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Went aboard.	She take a radio?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a hell of a lot of money.	What, you think there's something funny about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or somebody stopped them.	Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds like the hull.	Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bodies're too fresh.	Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn barbaric is what it is.	Could be meant as a warning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That'd be my guess.	So whoever did this might still be around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On a passenger ship in 1953?	If they knew what they were carrying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!	I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.	Maybe you can tell me then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The radio!	The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late.	Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's slow?	Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could be a fishing boat.	Too big. More like a freighter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean, before she sank.	Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then why didn't they take it.	Probably didn't have time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.	That's what I call a payday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a good thing?	Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffee.	You're a pal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay away. Or else.	Because of the gold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any dizziness?	No.
Headache, nausea, lights?	Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.	I feel fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Candy?	It's my pen name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffee?	Yeah. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No cowboy shit up there, understand?	No cowboy shit. Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got your light?	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Murphy to Epps.	Epps.
You just shoot at something?	Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's he doing?	Same. Any luck?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The ah... the radio's out.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smashed it up pretty bad.	But, who -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not gonna hold us.	Doesn't matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey.
Couldn't sleep.	Wish I could say the same.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Murphy to Epps.	Epps, over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Epps? You there?	Right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They went crazy.	Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Greer to Murphy.	Go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.	Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Too deep to anchor out there.	Looks like it's adrift.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call the Coastguard?	Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's funny.	How's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Murphy, goddamit.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning.	You're up late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?	Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard that.	Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?	We could call for help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Greer?	Moving to Sweden.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ho-ly shit.	Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never been more thirsty in my life.	Drink up then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're you feeling?	Lost my sea legs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a Noaa buoy.	A what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're still drifting.	The mooring hasn't come taught.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't find the shotgun.	So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?	Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen my blue spatula?	Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pumpkin? What's wrong?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!	But I can't --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...	Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what can you tell us about this...	Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, look at this guy.	Oh my God, that's HIM!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Josh.	Hi.
I just stopped in to say hi.	Yeah, well... hi...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi... what's up?	Can I come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you the one who left that note?	I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Enid.	Hey Josh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Since when is she an ""actress""?"	I know, she needs to die immediately.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!	We should follow them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Much later.	In fact, never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?	You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Al!	"Can we call you ""Weird Al""?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
I might actually get the pasta special.	You loser!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Oomie really like this show?	Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey - why do you have this?	You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at how cute I am!	What a little hosebag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!	Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.	Oh yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, maybe that's him!	It's still twenty-five minutes early.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"I want to ""make love"" to him."	I'm going to tell him you said that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SHUT UP!	She says she wants to MMPH!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he wearing a green cardigan?	What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's obviously him!	I can't believe it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think he knows?	I dunno...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure?	Totally! Look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's insane!	We should follow him home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.	I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?	Come on, it's too late now...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.	Somewhere downtown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Funky""?"	What, is she black now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We still have to go in there sometime.	It's always closed...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going?	Let's go hassle Josh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
JOSH!	JOSH!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll bet he never jerks off...	Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are we going here? I hate this place.	It'll only take a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ew ... when did you get that?	This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I totally, totally hate you.	Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me all your money, bitch!	Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!	Where?
Anthony's II!	No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.	You cunt!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That guy is totally amazing.	He does that every single day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	I need to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, whaddya think?	It's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want anything?	Maybe an orange juice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow... finally.	It just came yesterday...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about me? Am I not even here?	Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not.	Really? Both of you?... Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any other old records besides these?	Seymour does.
Who does?	Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You still interested in that?	I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...	It's kind of falling apart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.	Where did you get those pants?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Oh, how ""punk."""	That tape sucked, by the way!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go die, asshole!	Get a job!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much is it?	A dollar seventy-five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oops! I dropped it!	NO!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow! Look at all these creeps!	Shh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...	Are you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boo!	YAAA!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh... I think there's some root beer...	What about this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.	Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I agree.	I wish I could see him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we have here, Margaret?	It's a tampon in a teacup...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, doctor.	Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seymour?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning, friend, glorious day.	As are they all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Starting now, we attack them.	How; we don't know where they are?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pleasant journey?	How could it be? I hate Africa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lovely sound- they seem happy.	Don't they, though?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Understand, I had help-	-not a time for modesty, Bob-
<EOC>	<EOC>
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-	-please- you needn't be so graphic-
<EOC>	<EOC>
...one shot...	So that's what a lion looks like.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a good week.	You mean nobody died?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...misfire... it jammed...	Has it ever done that before?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think about something else.	Have you ever failed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did it look like this in your mind?	This is more difficult-
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am also liaison between these two.	Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yes, I think so.	Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For you.	Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?	I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?	I do, actually; very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Soon.	I have to ask- why do you need me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like him, don't you?	Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?	Since his beard was red.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He has children?	Once...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it?	Underneath.  Somewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Afraid of lions.	It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many cattle?	Four should do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever see a lion that size?	Not even close.  What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you go next?	Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, you didn't, Frank.	Okay, that's no problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do it.	I'll supervise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's where the buggy stopped.	Okay, let's take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not true.  It was 1620.	Same difference.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry!	Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I help you?	Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you going to call?	Ghostbusters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should we go?	I don't think we should leave her alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These boys aren't playing around.	You've got to stop them.  Please!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your honor, may I approach the bench?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I have some of your water?	Get on with it, counselor!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it?  That's all you have to say?	Did I forget something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.	Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a thousand million electron volts.	I knew that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were supposed to help me with this.	You need the exercise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"That's it?  ""I'll be back?"""	It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.	They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing.  Not a trace.	Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?	"His nickname is ""The Hammer."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Egon --	And we're the ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Six feet -- seven -- eight --	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!	Do it!  Just do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is the line sinking?	No, the slime is rising.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rivers of the stuff!	And it's all flowing toward the museum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.	There's something very familiar about this painting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great.  So what are you guys working on?	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?	Who?  Just -- someone we know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?  Who?  Who?	Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?	Dana!  Dana Barrett!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.	Okay, let's heat 'em up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Ray --	I'm Peter --
<EOC>	<EOC>
And now you're going to eat it?	No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks like a giant Jello mold.	I hate Jello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.	We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My Fault!	She's new in town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	I'm ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you telling me how to drive?	No, I just thought --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?	Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell him about the toaster.	I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And pure --	And decent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?	Wonder what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roy?  Your clock broke.	Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now where are you going?	To the bathroom, where do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!	Uuuuuuugh!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Dana, it's you ...	Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.	Are you sick, Louis?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you the Gatekeeper?	I am Zuul.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that your professional opinion?	It's in the stars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.	Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.	That's a violin concerto.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really don't act like a scientist.	No?  What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.	Thanks.  What's in there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's too bad.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-huh.	Well, let's check it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're quite a housekeeper.	I told you, I ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn!	Are you all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that got to do with it?	Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see it?  What was it?	We'll get back to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.  What is it?	A square?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Circle?	Close -- but definitely wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?	They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.	I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?	I'm always serious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something was definitely here.	Yeah, I can smell it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the Keymaster?	Oh, shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?	Full-stream with strogon pulse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, Buddy!	We'd better adjust our streams.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Set entry grid.	Neutronize.  System shut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was your date?	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So do I.	No sense worrying about it now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ray -- Something's here.	Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,	Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?	I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.	I don't think it's Shandor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agile bastard, isn't he?	Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stantz?  You okay in there?	LATER, MAN!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he talking about?  Choose what?	"What do you mean ""choose?""  We don't understand."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tribuus... tomorrow.	You're coming back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then you'd be out of a job.	Gladly Caesar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marcus Aurelius has died.	He left us at dawn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is my father?	Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Caesar?	Jerses -- tomorrow...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.	Yours will do!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's very realistic.	Isn't the helmet magnificent?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about their philosophy lessons?	They're studying with Cynics.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take your hands off me animal!	Chain him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
General, do you realize what happened out there today?	I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.	Don't be ridiculous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're living at home now. Is that right?	Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?	No.
Are you going to graduate school?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you always drive like this?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want some dinner?	I'd love some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you eating?	No.
Why not?	If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?	No -- why should I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you do it?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you take me home now?	I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.	But, Elaine --
Where is the car?	I just want to tell you something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?	No, I couldn't.
But could you try?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was she married or something?	Yes.
With a family?	Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?	No.
And it's all over now.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why aren't you ready?	Because I want to know what's happening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elaine --	Oh my God --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No -- don't cry --	GET OUT!
Don't cry.	Get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm meeting someone.	Ah. Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said I think it is.	All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.	Elaine -- I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Because it isn't true.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I just sit here while you're packing?	If you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do now?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going home?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Benjamin?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elaine -- are you serious about this?	I'll think about it.
You really will?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just don't think it would work.	Why wouldn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why wouldn't it?	I just don't think it would...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we getting married tomorrow?	No.
The day after tomorrow?	Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Benjamin?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ben!	Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben.	Mr. McQuire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You a student?	Not exactly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?	Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not one of those agitators?	What?
One of those outside agitators.	Oh -- no sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. McCleery?	You heard me. Out of here.
What for?	Because I don't like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
BENJAMIN?	Yes.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?	I have to go now. I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Robinson?	I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.	Could you bring it up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I help you, sir!	What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.	It's in the main ballroom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes sir?	A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?	A single. Just for myself, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?	It's down the hall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there an ashtray in here?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.	What?
Will you take me home?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right then.	What do you drink?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drink?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.	Benjamin?
Yes?	Will you unzip my dress?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?	Yes, I have --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I do.	I've got to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Benjamin?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Benjamin.	Oh. Hello. Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I sit down?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you?	Very well. Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have a drink?	A drink? Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't see me.	Waiter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you bring me a hanger?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- yes. Wood?	What?
Wood or wire? They have both.	Either one will be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're welcome.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you get out of the house?	I walk out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of car was it?	What?
Do you remember the make of the car?	Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.	It was a Ford, Benjamin.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!	That's enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't talk about Elaine.	Don't talk about Elaine?
No.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish you'd tell me.	There's nothing to tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello. Get me the police, please.	Where is Elaine?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I say I've got it.	Sir?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.	Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.	Goodnight, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.	Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going up to Berkeley today.	Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
<EOC>	<EOC>
They don't know?	No -- they don't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?	About an hour ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you two talk this over?	We haven't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm just --	-- worried?
Well --	About what?
I guess -- about my future.	What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --	To be what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say that again.	I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?	It's Benjamin.
Yes?	Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?	Can you look through the glass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you see me now?	Yes, I can.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?	Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is anything wrong?	No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Carlsons' are here.	They are?  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.	That what he says. Right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to speak --	Not now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like dancing?	Not with strangers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never?	You're a fool!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll dance.	All right. We'll dance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd given you up.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chasing around.	Chasing what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were very different yesterday.	Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Going?	Yes --
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.	Oh --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you understand?	Yes -- yes -- yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm worried about you.	Don't.
On the train?	Yes -- I will be on the train.
Till then.	Bless you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?	No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready, Kringelein?	Ready, Baron.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that too much, Baron?	No -- not at all.
All right then.	All right then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was my last.	You've lost everything?
I've no luck.	Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I take five hundred.	All of that at once, Baron?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, let the poor devil alone.	I did not ask your advice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?	I must have made a mistake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello! Hello! --	Don't do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that for me?	No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For me?	No -- letters to two-eighty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --	Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any letters?	No, Doctor.
Telegrams?	No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?	Nobody, Doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any letters?	No, doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?	For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, gentlemen.	I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.	More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I've got to find it.	Stay where you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dance then?	She's beautiful -- isn't she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please -- please!	You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.	Oh -- what -- what --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I!	Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...! --	I'm the stenographer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moreover --	Moreover --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moreover...	Moreover...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?	No -- only occasional jobs.
Tired?	You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --	Moreover...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this?	I got ten marks for that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You...	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.	Perhaps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Flaemm.	Hello!
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.	Presently, Mr. Preysing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.	I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Tomorrow morning.	No -- now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?	Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you pay some attention to me?	Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!	You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!	Well, he's a gentleman!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come here.	Here, hold up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, Preysing.	You've decided against the merger?
Yes --	Then, it's all over?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.	Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...	You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.	What a session this has been.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.	He likes to play the great man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I tell them again?	Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --	Ah, come on -- we're going home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't dance tonight --	It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.	But, Madam. cannot do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.	Send it away -- I shan't need it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.	All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Suzette.	Good morning, Madam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry, Suzette.	Such nonsense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.	I wish to be alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is time for the performance.	The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Pimenov.	Good morning, Gru -- your --
<EOC>	<EOC>
He will be on the train.	But when did he go? How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.	Again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We will wait.	You are late. Hurry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever hear about the oranges?	You mean, the insurance frammis?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Permanent damage.	You'll never shit right again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.	Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --	Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a look?	Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.	We're not really interested, Henry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ruined me! You destroyed me!	Henry, no!
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.	I'll get you a check.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whadaya say?	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kaggs. Home office.	Roy Dillon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.	Perk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's your story today?	They twisted my arm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They knocked out my tooth!	Only one tooth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not as tough as you, huh?	No. And you have to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tripped over a chair.	Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?	You don't have the stomach for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.	I pay my debts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Expecting visitors?	No. That was the point.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a drink?	I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?	Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't teach you that.	You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me see how you did that one.	Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.	You're too young. You should be in school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the five?	In your other hand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?	Always, for you, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?	Taking you for granite?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roy?	Mm?
Look at me.	Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?	All? It ain't bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?	I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her job.	I want to know everything about you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get well soon.	Every day in every way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Big spender.	You ain't seen nothin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	See you soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The tap. What you do for a living.	I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.	Myra, I'm not following this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think about it. Okay?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Open your door.
What?  What for?	Open it and find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it? What's going on?	I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.	) What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roy Dillon?	Yes?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not many laughs in this room, eh?	Not many.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Jesus.	No question, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's that, then.	Oh, yeah. That's that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One set of muddy shoe prints.	That don't match either of the victim's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carter.	It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Where?	The cemetery...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You take all your dates here. Blake?	Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.	Charming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carter.	It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.	The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.	Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be damned.	Do I know you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another historical inaccuracy.	Would somebody shut this guy up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jimmy, what are you doing?	Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.	And miss the big game?  No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the --	Betcha' didn't predict that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're twisted.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You some kind of fugitive or something?	I was trying to get away from someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He found you, didn't he?	Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...	Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.	John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?	John...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, God... no... not Molly.	Please, get on the bus...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not me.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?!	I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?	Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.	Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.	Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look kind of cold.	I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Linda!  He killed Linda!	Who?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?	Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.	Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you alright?	What?
What are you looking at?	I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?	He's my brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keri, you all right?	We've got to get these kids out of here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	What is it?
I have to pee.	Can't you hold it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You aced it, didn't you?	I did alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuckin' A.	He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better her than me.	You're unbelievable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shane's going as a condom.	I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.	You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let the party begin.	Have enough fun for the both of us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatever happened to women in back?	Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.	Guess so ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if your parents come home?	Then they can watch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you gonna answer that?	Answer what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?	The voice man!  He's here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Mom -- keep it on!	Okay ... But just for tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...	You can't expect us to stay here --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy!!!	Danny!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?	It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, what's wrong with him?	Here.  Let me try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the baby?!	He's gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!	Kara, no!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?!	Wait a minute ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on!	It's not working!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	It's a sign.  He's come home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are.  Who was that boy?	An old friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?	I'll meet you over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!!!	Stay away, Sam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!	No!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Home.	You know what gets me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And how were things?	Let's talk about something else.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Otherwise, how are things?	I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could have happened to anybody.	First Nagasaki--now this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's funny about that?	You know me, boy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?	The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.	You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.	I forget mine for years on end.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Insurance!	You actually sold insurance!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What an awful sound!	Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fifty years?	You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.	It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody home?	As a matter of fact--
Sir?	As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A hundred dollars!	The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?	Make it fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad--	Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?	Leave a tip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of exercise?	Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?	Who was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom?	What's this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?	No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Hamburger Heaven."""	Heaven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bluh.	You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that all about?	We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?	We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.	He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.	Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.	Paul said you were awfully sick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hasn't had breakfast yet.	Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!	It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!	Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now--turn around, if you would.	Turn around?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have some change!	Ram it up your ass!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Things.	You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to call the police.	Don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is suicide.  Go get the police.	Stop!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help your mother find the bullet.	There it is.  Give it to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do I load?	Load it for her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?	The National Safety Council would be appalled.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ooops.	Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?	Gentlemen--that's nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?	It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?	You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.	He's dead, you know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.	I came back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.	A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.	Are--are you crying, Penelope?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah!  You're ambulatory!	What a brilliant diagnosis!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought she was a widow.	You were wrong, you quack!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It died for your sins.	This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.	Lest we forget how cruel you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hands and knees, you say?	And terror, if you don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't do it.	Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So long, you guys.	What will you do, Colonel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank God!	What a relief!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate that thing.	It's beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?	Who have you been talking to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, he is.	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Norbert still here?	No.
Then who flushed the toilet?	Father's friend.
What's his name?	Don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom?	That man is your father.
What?	There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.	It is you, isn't it, Harold?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's why I'm crying.	Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	It is an emergency, isn't it?
Yeah.	Then get him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.	You're taking Mom out tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't have a maid any more.	Oh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate that thing.	Keeps fairies away!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coming.	Women are always late.  You'll find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know each other?	We met here earlier this evening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.  Thank you very much.	I believe in miracles now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here.	It's really that bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fool, you fool.	Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do it!	Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're still dressed?	Well, I want to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?	Yeah. How did you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joanne?	You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.	Do you know where she lives?
Nah.	Do you know where she would be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were going to bed?	I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's T-J?	Tijuana.
They were here?	Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?	He deals in pain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.	Where does he live.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you say that?	Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I bought it at a store in L.A.	Who made it?
I don't know.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.	Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm only human, you know.	Get out.
But this is my apartment.	Get out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you hear that name?	I just heard. Who is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened, pilgrim?	Just leave me alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, Jake?	Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your business, Jake?	Pretty good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jake?	How did you find me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wes, do me a favor.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.	You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Ratan?	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...	Ratan!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fifty cents admission.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here. Take your fifty cents back.	That's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold it, mister.	What do you think of that? Or this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?	He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.	You ever play Chicken?
What's that?	You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.	Well, a boy goes like this, see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does that do?	Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?	My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.	Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.	Well, he can just fuck himself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can fuck off, too.	You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.	Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.	How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.

Okay, lady. Out.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Haven't we met before?	None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.	Out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?	No, thank you. I have my car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you dance?	What?
Do you sing and dance?	Eh, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harold?	Maude???!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Oh. Eh, I like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you say that?	Because they are all the same.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Look.
What?	Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?	That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?	Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my. We're too late.	Is he all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?	Well, I really don't drink...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.	But I don't play anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?	Superb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's stopped.	The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.	Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I <u>think</u> I see it.	Yes. It's almost there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to join me in some cartwheels?	No. I feel more like - yodeling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But they'll put me in jail.	Really. Just put it there, Harold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you advance on me.	... of you. You'll all end up like this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about some candy floss?	Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure have a way with people.	Well, they're my species.
<EOC>	<EOC>
- end where I began.	Maude.
Yes.	Here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks like you. Thanks.	Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Supper for two.	Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.	Oh, Harold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to marry the woman I love.	Harold!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is insane.	Perhaps it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do?	Can't complain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like a cigarette?	No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you play?	No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, is this your father?	No. My uncle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.	Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.	Like a tea ceremony?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.	Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Parasite!	Harold!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay where you are, Harold .	She took my head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's different for us.	We've always been here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He... he loved me.	Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!	I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes... Yes. You look...	Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a beautiful dress...	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's done it.	She certainly has.
It's coming.	It certainly is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I knew you'd come back.	I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So... You're Kirsty, huh?	You a doctor, too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No bad dreams.	So you slept O.K.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...	Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What do you mean?	The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...	Yeah. The things you were talking about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
O.K. Let's go.	Kyle, you don't have...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.	What are you talking...
I've got to finish it.	Finish what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm scared.	No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... G'bye.	It's been Hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I didn't open it! I didn't!	Then why are you here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... remember.	You were ALL human!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He talked about Demons, huh?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"I need to touch it to ""see""..."	See what??
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.	Is he serious??
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't get psychic with me.	Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were burned by some organic acid.	I'm lucky that way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red. How long was it latched onto you?	I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.	Didn't even buy me a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remind me why I keep doing this.	Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
hound of resurrection --	See? I don't like that --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.	Air and sea backup. What's closest?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cordon off the area. Something came through.	From where??!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's almost over!!	No. It's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell was that? An ape?	No. It was red. Bright red.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't look! Turn around.	Is it bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's her choice --  She's human --	Oh, as opposed to -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you did break out --	I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.	"""Myers"", huh? You have a first name??"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.	We're on the move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.	Grounded? Who's grounded?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?	"His horns. He files 'em. To ""fit in."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, may I go first??	Not so fast. He barely knows him --
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's dead.	Noooo! Noooo!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	My job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding --	Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatcha looking at, John??	Oh-n-no -- I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Helping you -- I just --	No one ever helps me. It's my job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Myers??? How's your arm?	My arm is fine. Where are you??
<EOC>	<EOC>
What took you so long?	C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?	No. I never was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to hold him down?	That's right, Stud, hold me down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that??	Hostage negotiations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you --	Shh! Just a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, your chili's getting cold --	Not hungry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything else you --	Not from you.
Well good n-	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You better have that looked at.	Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, then.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I admire him. He's a force of nature.	He's just pushy.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --	Cocky.
Strong.	A brute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's freezing, isn't it?	Coffee's warming me up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hit me.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, I'm --	-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --	-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?	Two steps back, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.	Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.	Oh, sod you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ!	What's the problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's my lucky day.	Hi.
Want to buy a bed?	Not much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	We're leaving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you sign for the bed?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.	It'll go in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, let's give it another try.	Do you really need this bed, lady?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That your daughter?	Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.	Her mother's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me alone, will you?	No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No time for argument.	You did this before, right?
Many times.	To a man called Frank Cotton?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody escapes us.	HE did. I've seen him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We want the man who did this --	No. That wasn't the deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just in time.	Stay the fuck away from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got such sights to show you --	You can keep them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please. Get back into bed.	I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.	It's important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julia!	Kirsty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.	No.
You remember.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	One last time. Give me the box.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come to Daddy.	This isn't happening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're Julia, right?	That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is going to BE a wedding?	Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?	I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --	I don't want to see the dress.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Larry --	Forget him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wedded bliss?	I'm very happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julia.	Oh my God.
Don't look at me.	Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me.	Tell me who you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. God no.	Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?	His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Back from where?	Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
<EOC>	<EOC>
...somebody...	Ssh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm hurting	Hurting.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.	Keep your voice down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.	You're hurting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A long time.	You promised me an explanation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't love him.	I don't.
So where's the harm?	I said no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She'll tell them everything...	I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.	Maybe.
Don't you care?	There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --	Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --	I need a skin. Then we leave --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kirsty.	Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.	Which is where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kirsty? It's very late.	Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?	I have to see my father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?	I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.	I saw everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, damn you --	Oh my God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's ONE of these.	We're going to freeze to death.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe somebody changed the lock.	Like who?
Just a thought --	Ah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It smells damp.	It's just been empty a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long since you were here?	The best part of ten years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't he want to sell it?	I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're still blaming me.	No. I'm not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.	So what's the argument?
No argument.	Oh Christ. Julia...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Larry!	I hear you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you?	In here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you doing through there?	It looks like a bomb's dropped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you done?	I cut myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's probably going to need stitches.	I'm going to throw up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it slowly.	So damn stupid.
You're done worse.	I'll be scarred for life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julia?	I'm here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Just feeling a bit sick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.	Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.	Sure.
I'll be down in a minute	O.K.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was it?	Kirsty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this upsetting you?	I've seen worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- I'll go see.	No. I'll do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Larry...	What's wrong with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh baby.	Don't go upstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	Please...
What's wrong with you?	Please. I can't bear it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?	It's better you see for yourself --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not much fun, is it?	What?
Drinking alone.	Not much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know it's not often I... you know...	There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.	You want something to drink?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this your place ?	Do you care ?
No, not much.	Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't the bedroom.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	We don't need a bed, do we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose not.	I prefer the floor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
First time for everything.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.	Yeah, why don't I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you do the same?	Maybe I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, you're very beautiful.	Am I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Christ.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're awake. Good girl.	What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.	Wait a moment --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who brought me in here?	I won't be a moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wouldn't believe me.	Try me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's there?	Daddy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kirsty?	I got through.
Where are you?	I found a room.
What did you say?	I said: I found a room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well I want you to see the house.	I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Big house.	You like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you O.K.?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you drinking, love?	I've forgotten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.	Never better. You sleep well.
Yeah.	I love you, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She doesn't even want to leave the house.	Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to talk to you.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.	I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.	I want to see.
No you don't.	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the fuck out of here.	What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.	No. It's all over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I have to get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're on the Cointreau.	That's right. Cointreau.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won't be able to stand.	So lie down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going?	Just upstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need any help?	I AM house-trained.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm here.	I thought we'd lost you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I do know the way home.	It's late.
Not that late.	Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right.  No. That's nice.	If there's a train.
What do we do if there isn't?	We walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I beg your pardon?	There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no?	Oh no.
It's not what I heard.	Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!	Are you alright ?
I've been better.	Your father told me you were working here.
If I make it through the day.	I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steve. Thank God you came.	What happened to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
These THINGS... they want to take me --	What things?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Don't let them take me, Steve --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll come back later, huh?	Sure. Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Bye.	'Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I know you?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alison's.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.	IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	But now I kind of like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	"What do you mean, ""what?"""
What are you snickering about?	I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up?	Laura.  Her dad died.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The little skate-fuckers.	No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great.  Can I have it then?	No, you can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well what about the new Echo --	Do not get ahead of yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?	It's the new --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?	No.  The Righteous Brothers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's got one!	On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!	We work there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you going to see?	Nobody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it, Rob!	He's not worth it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?	Can I help you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I always hated this song.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's not.	I want a tape.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rob.	Liz, hold on a second --  What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rob --!	-- FUCK OFF!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.	Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --	You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I do anything?	"""Abraham, Martin, and John."" That's a nice one."
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this.	It's Vince and Justin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Laura?  Are you okay?	I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.	You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.	Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.	Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I help you?	Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So shall we leave it at that then?	I dunno.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.	I should be so lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess it's not that obvious, then.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	What, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hey, how ya doin'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	No, no.  When are you going home?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're soaking.	Mmnn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Laura...	I'm too tired not to go out with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go home.  Okay?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you worried about tomorrow night?	Not really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you live in Chicago now?	Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Marie.	Everything go alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	It's the best collection I've ever seen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you have more.	Well we don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I warned you.	Go to hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doesn't have a head, does he?	This one came unassembled.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like more tea?	No thank you, I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you play?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good reflexes.	Good day, Miss Cartwright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have friends.	I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He tried to kill me last night.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is he?	At the moment?  Carl Smith.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He sees me as a threat.	Are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	No one knows you're here?
No.  I had to talk to you.	You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.	You're a fool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  So what now?  We just wait?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.	They do it each year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.	Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then you must be at least 70 years old.	At least.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	That would be difficult to explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.	Come here, Brenna.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget it.	I'm just curious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm calling an attorney.	You and I should talk first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Corey, you _owe_ me.	It's that important?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe him.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Requiem acer'nam donaei-	What are you doing man?
-Et lux perpetua-	You'll not be bringing the church into this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be quiet.	-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.	-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is as you are.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen to me.  Hear the words.	This is madness!
It is the truth.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harder.  Concentrate harder.	Me arm hurts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!	Go to hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Impotent cow.	Muy Bien!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It will take less effort as you learn.	It's like to kill me first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm your future husband, remember?	I have no future husband.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh please.  Another one.	What would you like?
Something pretty.	Like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?	Far away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David.	Do you have cause to bothering us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who am I deceiving?	Certainly not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
State of grace and all that.	Tradition.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Romirez understood.  Not you.	Romirez is dust.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your name?	Mulet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.  I think we understand each other.	We have no understanding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do not turn your back on me.	You are really going to force this, aren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see Major?  You are not so different...	I had no choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.	Have you time for some- thing to eat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where!	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smith.  Carl Smith.	How many came?
The last four.	And the Bulgarian?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.	He knows I'm here.  How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He found us even there.	He always did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't drunk this much since-	-Since you last saw me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Long time.	Not so long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Friend of yours?	Of sorts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Run!	MACLEOD!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.	Leave her alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have some unfinished business.	Are you here?
I want you to come to me.	And if I refuse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes laddie, I have her.	Should I care?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What were _you_ looking for?	That's none of your business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My condolences.	Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.	A neighbor saw your car leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing to be sorry about.	Just your pappy scared some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?	Why don't you fellows get your own news?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?	Hildy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	What's the idea of locking this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.	Open this door!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got my rhyming dictionary in --	It doesn't have to rhyme!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll keep you in mind.	Au revoir, mon capitaine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About twenty-five hundred dollars.	Better make that a certified check, Walter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?	Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	I lost my wallet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hildy!	Hello, Bruce...
<EOC>	<EOC>
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?	Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, she was here.	Where'd she go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're Bruce Baldwin?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother? But your mother --	No. My mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything the matter?	Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.	You haven't seen anything yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, she'll know some day.	That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.	Thanks a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call Duffy!	No, you don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Get out of here, you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Save that for the Tribune.	What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what does he want with you?	Now you got me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Allow me.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?	Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.	I know. Where is he, I said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hildy!	All right, Walter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?	What did you do with her?
What happened?	You been in a fight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she? Tell me!	Louie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't tell me -- was she killed?	Was she? Did you notice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, you don't! Walter!	What is it? Here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute!  Let go there!	Murder, uh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you deliver this first?	Who did you talk to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hildy!	Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?	Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!	Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about Bruce's?	Walter, you can't do that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But, Hildy -- I can explain --	You -- you!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you referring to me, Madam?	You know you did!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!	You grey-haired old Judas!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stay here. I'll find out everything.	Western an' Thirty-fourth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know me. The shirt off my back.	You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.	I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?	I think it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?	Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I call. What you got?	Three bullets! Any good?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Open up there, will you!	All right -- all right!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She looks as though she's going to come to.	Give me a hand with her, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better let us in on it, Mollie.	Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.	Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys wanna play some more poker?	What's the use? I can't win a pot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, did you see her go?	Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So have we!	What's the dope, Sheriff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.	Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold the phone!	I'll have it in a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll call.	Three sixes. Is that any good?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Yonson.	So long, Hildy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a chase!	No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't gettin' out o' here!	Now, where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We know what you're up to.	Probably goin' out to get Williams.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's everything, Gus?	I can't complain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No -- just coffee, Gus.	Just coffee.  And you, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.	That's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gus, this --	Good coffee, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a minute, Johnson!	Let go o' me. What's the idea?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take your paws off me!	Hold her, boys!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's harmless.	Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?	You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For who?	Earl Williams. The reprieve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.	No, I couldn't do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pure politics!	An attempt to ruin us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll fix that, too.	Just -- one -- second!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is this man?	Throw him out, Frank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a lie!!	I never saw him before!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got you, Williams!	Go on -- shoot me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!	My name is Louis Peluso.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the old lady?	I'm telling you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There goes another scrub lady.	I'll go right after it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any news?	Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fight it cut.	And up a dime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.	I thought so, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get that, Hildy?	No -- what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look out, you --	What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kings and sixes.	That's good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiding him where?	Mother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother!	That man there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't forget about production for use.	I won't, Earl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.	Put down that gun, Earl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What good'll it do?	We'll get you out in ten minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they gone? You know where they are?	Wait a minute, Mollie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Quiet, Mollie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll get him! They'll get him!	Ssh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.	I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the idea?	Never mind! Just play dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey --	Shut up, you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right, now?	Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who? Me?	Who do you think!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here!	You can't bribe me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They wouldn't take it.	You're insane!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.	Hello, Mollie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look out!	Look out where you're aiming, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the cops, somebody.	Come on, fellas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There she is!	Say, Hildy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your hurry?	We want to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baldwin -- his name is.	I give that marriage six months.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The door was locked.	She and Mollie were talking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is going too far, young man.	But Grandpa, you said...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give him the you-know-what.	Very well, Grandpa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's true.	You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pauline's mum got killed.	No, she didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here? This is our territory	Looking for shrapnel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never was.	Yes, you was. Make him talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know a secret.	What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.	Who told you that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to join our gang?	I don't mind.
Do you know any swear words?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go and ask her if she wants to play.	Ask her yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell them about Pauline's mum.	Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.	We thought it was poison.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did see them. I did.	He's the worst liar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're the biggest fibber.	It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't we just see the end?	They've got the real thing outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crocodiles! Aah!	The sodding water table.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, that was some air-raid.	Air-raid?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.	Bugger the Buffs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't panic!  Keep your head!	I will if you will!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're going to be a grandfather.	And I'm still just a lad myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's to music. And absent friends.	And absent bridegrooms!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Has Sue got it right?	What's that?
You joined up.	Oh, that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what's that?	Jam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't know anything about it	Well, it's off ration. We know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	It looks....foreign.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?	You taste it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When do you think you'll get leave again?	Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.	I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know it? It must be an old one.	Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He always knows.	Half the time he's bluffing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, pet?	He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe this is happening to me.	It's not. It's happening to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now take deep breaths, and push.	Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it peace in out time?	No, Mother! It's War! War!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't do it. What's the point?	It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.	Grace!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It seems to have survived.	Play something, Grace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.	Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're having me on, Molly.	Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.	Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.	Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to find them.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you start with me?	You're not them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mine.	Have you always had it?
I don't know.	Have you looked inside?
Yes.	What's inside?
Humans.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to stay?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you still want me to stay?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need some gas?	Please.
Only got one kind.	That's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hell of a night.	You got that right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bathroom?	Round back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son ... are you awake?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that, Dad?	That's the Air Force Base.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are more this year than last.	This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... and Rigel.	And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right, Dad?	Sure ... fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had an awful dream.	What, Jim, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.	I was so scared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm home now.	Yes -- but ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he talk to you about?	He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?	Why, yes.  Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know how to follow a map?	Yes.  I can even read star maps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.	I don't see anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it look to you like anything landed here?	Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you call the State Police?	All their lines were busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No one comes here after dark.	Hide the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn.	I know a way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George, where have you been?	What happened to your other slipper?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your father asked you a question.	What? -- I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.	The back door was open.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?	Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?	Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?	David, don't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just my luck, no ice.	I take it you've heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Did it work?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.	My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're losing them.	Then get them out of there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is this?	So sue me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what?	Checkmate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pops, you're a genius!	What'd I say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.	Oh shit, we're late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing?	Just getting a feel for her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?	Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get us out of here!	I can't shake her free.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing?	It's not me. They're overriding the system.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice meeting you.	You as well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're loose!	Doesn't matter. Game's over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is my wife in the air?	She should be shortly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they?	ETA with target; four minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're we doing?	Better than we thought.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?	I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Grey, you read me?	Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.	This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's impossible...	My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is ridiculous.	How long would their shields be down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A meteor?	No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?	Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?	It's... slowing down, Sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's trying to impress you.	He's doing a good job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late.	You know me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You scared the hell out of me.	Yeah, but what an entrance!
Dick-weed.	Butt-munch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn it!	I didn't even see them fire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.	We're already over Mach 2!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stevie... I can't...	Jimmy, stay with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it.	It's all fuzzy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They let you out?	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's going on?	We're leaving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?	Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. President?	Deploy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!	Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.	You are on your own?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.	And I am his.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My reputation precedes me.	There is no museum in Iskenderun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Papers, sir. Got it here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
<EOC>	<EOC>
May we go home now, please?	The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marcus!  I did it!	You've got it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your treat.	Yes. My treat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?	It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Venice, Italy!	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That doesn't look much like a library.	It looks like a converted church.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!	Dad was onto something here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about you?	I'm going after Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marcus!	Arghhh! Oh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Henry! What are you doing here?!	It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Henry, the pen --	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look what you did!	It's war.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Word of God...	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm through!	We're through!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doctor Jones?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fraulein -- will you permit me?	I usually don't.
I usually don't either.	In that case, I permit you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Ark of the Covenant.	Are you sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't wander off.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said go around!	You said go between them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My room!	Mine, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This.	The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.	You had it? You didn't trust me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you know about this place?	I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	Don't know. Think of something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This one. I think he's in here.	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you get here?	Where is it? I want it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You came back for the book? Why?	My father didn't want it incinerated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All I have to do is squeeze.	All I have to do is scream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never expected to see you again.	I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!	It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad!	Out!
It's important!	Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --	Junior!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is you Junior!	Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?	I came to get you! What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it breaks the heart.	And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I'll never forgive myself --	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! Don't Shoot!	Don't worry. He won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What am I looking for?	My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.	Try and burn through the ropes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad!	What?
Dad!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Head for the fireplace!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is intolerable!	I'm out, Dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad!	...the solution presents itself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't know you could fly a plane.	Fly... yes. Land... no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!	What happens at eleven o'clock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice landing.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those people are trying to kill us!	I know, Dad!
It's a new experience for me.	It happens to me all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is intolerable!	This could be close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!	Dad, we're well out of range.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?	You call this archaeology?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?!	Junior...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The penitent man is humble before God.	Penitent. Penitent...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you find, Junior?	Junior?! Dad...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like Indiana.	We named the dog Indiana.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-huh.	After you, Junior.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.	I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get that camel out of the way!	What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.	Come on -- come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going after those horses.	I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.	But, Indy --
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your last chance.	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I believe we're being called to dinner.	Finally!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.	There are no stories anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Jones.	Lao She.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have insulted my son.	Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!	Step on it, Short Round!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indy?	Okay, Shorty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I ride with you, Indy?	Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indy, look!	That's it. Pankot Palace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you look at, Indy?	Just a statue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come one, what's wrong?	Behind you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let up on the brake!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, the stones are mine!	You're betrayed Shiva.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like the service here.	Hey, he's not a waiter...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!	Who cares? Where's that diamond!
<EOC>	<EOC>
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!	Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!	The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And then they took their children.	Their children?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indy! Help me!	Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A what...?	A SNAKE!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	It's starting to let go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!	I know the feeling...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Couldn't keep away, huh?	Just try and control yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any more complaints?	Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!	Maybe he likes older women.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not leftovers?	No -- real food.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Primitive sexual practices?	You're talking to an authority in that area.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	What -- the bug?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!	Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A fulcrum release lever!	I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a hole! I found a square hole!	That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!	Willie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go! Let's get out of here!	Quiet!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indy? Did you talk to them?	Yes.
So now they believe me.	Yes, they believe you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're we going to do?!	There's got to be another way out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't!	Go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!	What above the curves?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anymore ideas...?	Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.	Not quite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I get it!	You got it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me your hat...	What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!	Willie, come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said something.	I know you did!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, not her. Me.	Who's you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is AL.	Al ???!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you,...Al?	You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.	I'm...inside you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!	What's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus	Don't do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Arrrgh!	It wasn't him.
Who was it?	Me.
Who?	Al.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Al.	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in my head...	Yes.
Your name is Al...	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	Who am I?
Yeah...Who?	Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've heard of the PEM114...	That a new Datsun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you threatening me?	I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know...it sounds insane.	You said it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be alive.	With a man in my head...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	Who was that? Somebody out there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyone there?	No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Behind us?	Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do?	Outrun them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wouldn't say that.	Then what are you stopping for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know...To get Al.	No. Don't tell the guards.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear that?	Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It can't take that long.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
JOE Or what?	I don't know. I don't want to find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.	Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sue them.	I'll sue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like the sound of that.	We have to get out of here.
Door's locked.	See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what.	Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?	With Authority!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way do I go?	What does it say.
Corridor A.	Take a left and your next right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?	I can't remember..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?	Nothing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm back.	I'm at the airport.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean...just leave.	We get on a plane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about money?	What about it?
I don't have any.	Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.	Why not?
It's illegal.	Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.	You are in trouble. Now do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll know who I am.	We'll change your appearance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	The beach.
The beach?	How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Eating sushi?	Just get there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit!	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Al, are you doing anything in there?	What? What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beautiful!	What was?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This must be business, there's nothing else here.	Follow it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's...pretty fast.	You're out of shape.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	She's beautiful...! What do I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're beautiful..	What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.	Try another language.
Which language?	How should I know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me out, will you?	What can I do? You're on your own.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do?	Don't just stand there, say something.
What?	Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
.	.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	Wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she staying?	Where are you staying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Touch her.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Joe.	No...you idiot!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	...Rene...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.	Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, where would I be?	What are you looking at?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But what's it look like?	What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really like that shirt?	This...is not going to work out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Much too blue.	Not blue enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind your own business.	It is my business. It's my name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not that tie with that coat.	Why not?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did that cost?	You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one is she?	The beautiful one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They both look good to me.	You have no taste.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get close to them.	That place. By the window.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not just after this girl, are you?	Who, me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Follow that busboy.	Are you serious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel like an idiot.	Just hold them close and stay still.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one?	The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just don't show fear.	I don't know what's going on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe, be careful!	...I've lost something. I must get it back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, your charm?	This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.	Not her. You!
What is it?	You can't listen. You can't watch either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What Happened?	I don't know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..	Is that all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's got the most beautiful...s	Shit! You're in love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And on my time.	It's not your time. I get time off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You been had. We have.	It wasn't like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some agent you are.	Why don't you get out of my face.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bingo.	You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.	That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.	Osaka?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do?	Follow her.
On what?	Run, stupid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, she's getting away.	I can't keep up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.	That's not funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.	What do I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't touch a thing.	Don't worry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...drink it.	Too late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What next!	Drink lots of water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't...	You have to! Quickly!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow!	A hard left. A hard left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Door to the right. Get up and run.	I can't see a thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Never mind, just say it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was with Gruner!	You were with GRUNER!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's him.	Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...	I've got an idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was it? What'd I say?	You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
haka xuki.	haka xuki. What's that mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Left...The one with the red dot.	Well...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hung us up dry.	While he makes the run.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do it.	I can't handle that thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aim just in front of his face.	Aim what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy...	...Shit! It's just money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a lot you don't know.	And don't let her know, either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This may hurt.	Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do something.	What exactly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Losing power. The laser drained it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She is beautiful.	You've changed your mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.	Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a lucky man.	Yeah, sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.	You're lovely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just got a Mickey.	RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not that truth!	Aren't we all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry...	It'll remind me of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doesn't matter.	What part what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is your name?	Don't give her your name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	Oh, I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?	Dieter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm against it.	I insist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you fly this?	Don't worry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of a deal?	Let us get to the border!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I knew you were trouble.	Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?	It's a long story.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They have stolen state property.	What a nerve!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't tell us you were coming?	Then how did you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've cut your hair?	I dyed it. We're all getting old.
<EOC>	<EOC>
PEM115!	**?!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll have to let them go.	Surveilliance on them all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is your friend?	We met on the beach.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here, where've you been?	I have a new client.
That crazy guy?	Yes. Joe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	He's not an ordinary man.
Enough ROmance.	He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to intrude.	We insist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Foreign service.	And how do you service foreigners.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And...you know Jan Gruner?	I think I've heard of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe.	What?
Take the card.	Oh yeah, thanks...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Al?	The little man in my...  ...head...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ahhh...nothing.	Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.	Been hearing voices.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sue who?	You...him...UST.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!	I noticed you staring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You may you find all the solitude you want.	Thanks, I appreciate that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it!	Just give me the keys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?	We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now you know what I know.	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The fresh tuna?..	Yessir...very good sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh...and who is it!?	I didn't say anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you do about what?	...I'm looking for someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is someone else here?	No. No one to speak of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Blake	Blake?
The poet...something he said...	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blake said that?	Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be right there.	Where?
Dinner...tonight.	Oh...I can't. Business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you.	...right here too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't do that?	Do what?
Let you leave without it.	Without what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's so funny?	Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
What way?	Like there's someone else here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait. What's your name?	...Rene.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean from it.	Yes, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you?	I just work for the travel firm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You again.	Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe! What happened to you?	Why'd you run off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you leave?	They left. I had to go with them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.	This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. He mentioned a city.	What is it?
Hiroshima.	Get your things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where we going?	Beats me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	He plays it all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That must be him. Water taxi.	Get us one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where what?	Where would you go to sell a chip?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I said just relax. I'm in full control.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chiang Cho?	...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.	You've  been there?
I know the territory.	You coming along?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So do I.	This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.	He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	Can you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I can't fly it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a mess.	You can say that again. What do we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry I got you into this.	It was my choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.	Why did you, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	I've never met anyone like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry.	Why not, what are you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just like that?	I'll come back for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You son of a bitch! You conned me!	You're gonna laugh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kiss her you fool.	Her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you? Who do you work for?	Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.	Now what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.	That's twenty feet high.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Riuji?	I told you, I work for him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	We're not moving fast enough for him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must be a fulfilling occupation.	It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What could you find in this place?	...Piece of mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there anything else?	A drink...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	Why?
You can't take that.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's alright.	It is?
It will be fine. You have another.	Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.	I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.	Tear it apart?
Yes.	Ahhh...Okay?!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom...what are you doing here?	Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right there.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This the only spare?	Yes.
The other working.	Perfectly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow?...	It'l be alright.
It will.	It doesn't hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Screw the PEM...What about Al...	Poor bastard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?	What does he know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, nobody knows we did it.	Whoever took it does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'l take months.	So we better get started.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, honey.	Hi, Daddy.
What's new?	Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?	For reading.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.	She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.	She was playing with the Pooh doll.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take some.	Instant rice...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, baby. What's wrong?	What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?	I heard them.
Where?	In the backyard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's into kind of little cars, that...	That remote control thing?
Yeah.	Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.	Yes, baby?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.	How long?
Three hours.	You got a deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Yeah. Catch you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When's the air date?	Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that about?	Get me Wigand.
Sure.	...fuck is this? Fuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want more rice?	Maybe later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you cooking?	I'm cooking pasta primavera.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?	Yes, I'm afraid I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A gun? Yes.	What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?	Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That computer has everything...	You alright, Mr. Wigand?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Debbie...	Hey, Lowell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.	No, no, we're fine...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike... Mike... Mike...	"""Mike?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Lowell.	How are you, Jim?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, baby.	Catch you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Jim, it's Lowell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lowell?	Did I tell you you were wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can take her.	Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?	Yes, it's on the stove...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?	Try the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...taping?  What are you taping?	I'm doing an interview.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.	Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.	What's the difference...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Bob.	Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --	Did you say Berman?
"No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with ""60 Minutes""..."	"""60 Minutes""?"
Yeah.	"""60 Minutes,"" the television show?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will independent sources corroborate that?	Hello? Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.	"...""ignition propensity?""  ...you understand any of this...?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!	They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?	I'm alone on this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeffrey Wigand...	Jeffrey...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah...	...you fucked me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...	"What ""Seven Dwarfs?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Well, it isn't ""cigarettes are bad for you""..."	Hardly new news.
No shit.	What's this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, is everything okay?	How are the rooms? Comfortable?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, man.	Who are these people?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?	Alright. What did you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That Canada story? Still interest you?	Everything interests me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffee?	Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?	What I've seen... I've liked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you like your coffee? Black?	Black, black...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...but that's as far as I go...	Far as you go where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I just take the documents now?	If you want to do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?	Jump in, quick, c'mon...
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mere. I want to talk to you.	Good. I want to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The new place? New.	You okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you know that, Lowell?	It's obvious, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you get us?	Tempura...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good. But Jeff...	I'll call them, Lowell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lowell, I can't afford --	"...they ""volunteered."" A friend owns a large security company."
<EOC>	<EOC>
You attract a crowd.	Yeah, great.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...	I don't know what to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's changed?	You mean... since this morning?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you, anyway?	I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.	Yeah. Yeah, I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did he hear you?	You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about now?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?	There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?	Liane has filed for divorce...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baby. You are so HOT!	Howard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?	After you, Doll.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.	Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	I had no idea until after, but --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in a rush.	Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.	Mr. Dumbarton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's his lawyer.	Triple!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Objection, your honor!	Grounds?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.	We rest, Your Honor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in check.	I should be in therapy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm happy for you, pal.	Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?	Asian? No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God.	What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.	Yes?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.	What do you mean, was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.	So, that's good, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marylin! What have I done?	I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So who'd you hire?	Ruth Rabino.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're vulnerable.	It's about time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said 'yes' didn't you?	I said yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Well. He said to ""make the house mine."""	Oh boy. If he only knew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It sounded like a bell.	I'll be right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These are yours.	Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I assume this is on Rex?	Isn't everything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.	Did you see the tape?
Not yet.	See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.	And you've always loved him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll regret this.	Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- we are both sure that's what we want?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that you?	Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?	Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And here I thought my mother was...	Your mother was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Friends?	Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't have a ring!	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hello Marylin.
I have a surprise for you.	I bet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't like me?	I love you. I want to have your baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
STUFF.  Got a light?	"What kind of ""stuff?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a no go, Joe.	Marylin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.	I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweet.	I thought so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Rex.	Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.	My whole metabolism is -- off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you need a Tagamet?	You have some?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?	Sometimes I forget.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was devastated. Of course.	Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	Jesus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this a lover?	Please!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's she?	Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe.	We do have a man for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lilly's up.	Oh, God!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every week --	I'm dying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.	Hello Miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.	I want to be exposed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this Ming?	It's not Ming. It's Tong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Herb wants to see me?	When you have a moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you familiar with Kirshner?	Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...arty farty!	Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...	Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
And it's good!	I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.	...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where does that leave us?	We've outlined a settlement...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait... He wants to give her...?	Nothing.
And she has...?	Video.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wrigley!	Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.	I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?	No. You're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.	What...?
She owes me a meal.	I'd stay away from her, Miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Warne?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter Warne!	Why? Do you know him?
Oh, nono.	You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.	Oh, please, Dad
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's my daughter! Go after her.	Lower the boats!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I haven't the slightest idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it.	But the lady says
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Driver!	Yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?	Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell that man not to drive so fast.	Are you talking to me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course I do. What do you mean	Beat it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, just a minuteyou can't	Shut up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you mind joining the Israelites?	You're not really serious about this, are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you mind putting out the light?	Not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This looks like the best spot.	We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Oh, Peter
What's got into you?	Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.	What?
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.	Try me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you going to do?	Mind your own business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?	Yeah, swell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE	Why, you bully. I believe you would.
sixseveneightnine	I'm out! I'm out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.	Whome?  Want to see me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?	Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No harm in your coming to see us.	Not interested.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eight o'clock tonight.	Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's your ticket, ma'am.	Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.	When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady	Husband?
Yesif he is your husband.	Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.	Why, he'll be back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been thinking about you.	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!	What time is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm hungry.	Just your imagination.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up?	Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Collect?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here!	Wait a minute, GordonI
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.	Okay, pete.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thenyou'll have to git !	Yeah, you'll have to git .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not a minute!	Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah.	Zeke.  Git!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you're two up on me now.	Hey, you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	There's a seat over there for you.
What's the idea?	I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind.
Wife?	Yeah. Come oncome on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?	The anonymous kind, Chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you get some sworn statements?	That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, all right.  Break it up.	Where you going, boss?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, look what I drew.	That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy!  Where have you been?	Hi, Freckle Face.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	I know.

<EOC>	<EOC>
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?	They told me.

How much is there?	Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Where did you shoot her?	In the chest and stomach.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Cherry Bail Bonds.	Let me speak to Max Cherry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He ain't here right now.	He leave town?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Dream on!	No! Oh God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.	No, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.	Della?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.	I see.
What do you want?	Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?	Like Della.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.	Hello, Sam.
Are you all right?	I'm okay.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.	No, don't. But thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy!	Oh God!
You're hurting me!	Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.	What do you want from me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have an unusual hand.	I could have told you that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy, what was that noise?	Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.	It was the window.
It's cold.	Tell your mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.	Why do you say that?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.	But the paper ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean, demons?	He told me he was going to Hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He say what they looked like?	No. Not really ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Carlson's dead?	An explosion, just like Paul's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.	I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.	Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.	Carlson? Is he new here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jacob, what can I do?	Save me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.	Your back? Did you fall?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That help?	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You up?	No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?	I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?	Jezzie, I can't see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that the one who died?	Gabe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait. Don't.	I don't like things that make you cry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jake!	How's it going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.	Where are we?
We're at Della's.	Where?
What do you mean? Where do you think?	Where's Della? Bring her here?
Why? What for?	Show me Della!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't you stop it?	If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it say? A hundred and two?	I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does it say?	It's gone to the top.
How high is that?	The numbers stop at 107.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doin'?	Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.	Get your clothes off!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's coming right over.	Coming here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't do it.	What kind of man are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't gimme that.	Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!	Sam, Tony, come in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me! Help me!	Here. I'll do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?	Who are you? What are you doing to me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?	Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?	Sit down!
No! What's going on? Where's my family?	It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?	Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't happening.	Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I'm falling asleep.	Pleasant dreams.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't move.	Just relax.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's burning up.	Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.	Push 'em back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clear the area. This is an order!	What is wrong with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dream on!	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's burning up.	Total delirium.
He'll never make it.	That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.	Help me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll page him.	Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.	Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not a dream! This is my life.	Of course it is. What else could it be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Jacob Singer?
Speaking.	Paul Gruneger!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I help you?	I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want me to get someone?	No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch it punk, I'm armed.	Punk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That sucks. Why won't he go down?	Pause play.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Asshole that does not count as a kill.	Yes it does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, enough of this shit.	Alright, asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!	What do you mean, not enough time?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?!!	If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't lead him into the other hull!	We don't have a choice!
<EOC>	<EOC>
His mother?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Minimal.	We made it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bomb?	Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?	Rizzo did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sergeant!	Get out of here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-oh.	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay that hurt.	Thorgan, pull us in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where have you been?!!	He....He...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell were you?!!	He came for me, I had to run!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Creepy.	Cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice touch.	And you said high school was boring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see that?	Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better let me.	Where'd you get the gun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone okay?	I think I broke my arm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!	The hull's imploding!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not supposed to do that.	What are you gonna do, tell me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll need system four converters.	They're back here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!	I'm coming, I'm coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kay-Em!	What are you doing back?!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Done!	Let's move out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, my love.	Thorgan, suit up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!	Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd need charges.	We could convert fission transistors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many?	Bring 'em all. Let's move!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.	Then stop talking and work faster!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what do we do?!	I don't know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry!	Faster! Don't we have another gun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It bought us some time.	And now we're all out of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Earth II.	Suit up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get them in the lab!	Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing?	My job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute...I need...	Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yllo, what's your head count?	Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sergeant!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm with you kid.	Where is he?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.	No, you're dead! You're all dead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, God!	Oh man, what the hell happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.	Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kicker, anything?	Negative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?	Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is everybody? What happened?	Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?	Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.	Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pull me in!	I'm pulling, damnit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	We have to get off this ship.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Outta here?	Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.	Guys!!! The shuttle?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!	No you don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if you miss?	What if we don't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.	And what happend to ...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See? We're not so bad.	Not so bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it.  You ever space walked?	Oh sure, all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanna release your air tanks?	Okay, good tip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?	I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?	I think so, why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Delongpre, you don't even know me.	I know you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rizzo, pull away!	I'm stuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's time.	What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spunky . . .	She broke my fucking nose!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	She needs a little time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!	Oh I like her a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!	No shit. I got no problem with that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now hold on! We should hear her out!	She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yuck.	We're screwed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!	He's right behind us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kaboom.	Again?! Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?!!	Just come on, I've got an idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.	Well, do something!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's trying to ask you out on a date.	Shut up, Thorgan!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I...I don't know what I did...	You lost the charge?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now that's just gross.	GO, GO, GO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now this is getting exciting.	Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is what it means right here.	Small brains make your balls itch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna spew.	That ought'a help the situation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry! She's lost it!	So what else is new?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're so bossy.	You're leaving me here alone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're quicker than usual.	Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus!	Oh my God! Adrienne?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do?!!	Crutch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.	Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know...sorry?	Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm surrounded by idiots.	You need to get laid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.	You killed him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't say I was good at it.	Oh shit! There he is!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just you and me, then.	Come here, might as well fix that arm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Almost done.	Ow!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.	Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, sorry.	Who are you apologizing to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kay-Em, you okay?	Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Ssh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know?	I just know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something's wrong.	Keep trying!

The power's back up!	Then open the doors!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.	What?!!

You're not going anywhere.	You wanna die?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What good will that do?	They can deal with this sort of thing.
More soldiers?	Scientists. Very intellegent men.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guys, please come with me!	4You're not going anywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you open the damn door?	You're crazy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.	Three...two...one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?	Hockey player? He's not a ...

<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you done?	What have I done?! Idiots.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes!	Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we get through these?	Sure but what good will that do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guys, he's right behind us!	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son! -- Out of the water now!	My boat's neat, dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My cars. And a comic book.	Here --  Take him home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Matt Hooper...	I know who he is...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never saw one that big.	What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.	C'mon. Middle appendix --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that one, there?	Tattoo. Had it taken off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!	Where...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it! Radio in for help!	Shut up! Just pump her out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get him in the head?	No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about us?	Have to pump her steady, s'all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's trying to sink us!	Dead astern! Zig-zag!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.	Full throttle! To port!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's comin' up -- !	He's taken him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't forget these.	Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sexy, hm? What was I before?	Older, sillier.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful.	Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Love ya.	Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you stand something to eat?	Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mikey loves his birthday present.	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You too, sweetheart...	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Home... New York?	No. Home here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.	What'll I tell the kids?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only 24 hours!	I didn't agree to that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's right.	Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dynamite!  How was your day...?	Swell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.	Let's all have a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I want to check something. Hold my feet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?	They must've hit something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope we get some more help.	I wish it would rain...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This has got to be one big violation...	This is quite a place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that, a ship?	You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell?	It's a whale out there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What day is this?	Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?	Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...	I can't imagine why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?	We never had any. What's the problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not even sure what it was.	What else could've done that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanna call it a night after here?	It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leg of lamb this time?	Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
One more after this, then I'm going home.	Set?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?	Twenty years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at him take it!	Do I set the goddam hook?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like something? Some coffee?	Is anyone having this...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.	Let me see your hands...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Over there!	What do you see?
<EOC>	<EOC>
20 feet, if it's an inch...	25 feet. And three tons of him there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...	Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll drink to your leg.	And I'll drink to yours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy! It'll tear right out!	The shaft is giving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's heading under -- !	No way! He can't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Follow him!	He's under!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?	I don't have it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?	I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.	I'm not hungry, oddly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Bleek.	Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.	Cool.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.	My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?	I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, Bleek.	Well, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're being really immature.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nails? Really?	No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.	Geeeerta Rauuuss!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.	What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.	Oh.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.	Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your guitar is named Kimber?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?	Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow. That shirt is working hard.	Is Vanessa here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool.	Come on, I have something for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, okay. Like this.	You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.	What are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm leaving Vanessa.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I take your coats?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.	Oh really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...	This is the baby. Your baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!	Elbow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Juno? What's going on?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. I'm here for the big show?	Your name, please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Either I just pissed my pants or...
Or...	Thundercats are go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.	That is sick, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?	It was magnificent, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Penny Saver sucks.	Yeah, but it sucks for free.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aw, please Junebug?	No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!	Share the love, Tits!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hly shht!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.	Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way! She's pretty.	You sound shocked or something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.	Right, seriously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, why is everyone always staring at me?	Well, you are kind of... convex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. What's that thing?	A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?	You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.	Are you looking for any other compensation?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.	Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys are playing music?	Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're actually, finally doing this?	Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?	Yeah, downtown.
A hotel?	It's a loft.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lose!	I suppose anything's possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, I'm Adele.	Carrie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Pardon?	...I said, I like your hair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you takin' the pictures?	...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?	Not really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?	...Yeah, sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You dropped this.	Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better not, or Early'd whip me.	He whips you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm cool.	Could I try that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You took this picture?	Took 'em all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shouldn't let him do that to you...	Do what?
Adele... are you serious?	You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The police are after him, he's a murderer!	...That's not true.
What?	That's not true!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy birthday Adele.	Early, you are so sweet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?	Almost.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.	I heard that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if they're dangerous?	They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Geez, they look kinda weird.	You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?	As many times as it takes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah but, what is it?	I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!	Early! Stop!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you from Walter?	Vernon, Florida.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?	Turkey mostly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Mind if I hold that Bible?	What do you need a Bible for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tight fit.	Best kind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't hurt.	How much do I owe you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That bad?	...Then some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.	Ain't you goin' to record it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Well then, that's how many I killed.	If you say so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!	...Ha.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two been busy in here.	What happened to Adele?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.	Thank god!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.	The party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.	It was definitely the high point of the evening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.	Thanks. What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how's it going?	...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he sound like on the phone?	Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like that.	I still think we should have met them first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All set?	Fuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Look again!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's more...	I'm finished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brian I want him out of our car!	Why, what did he do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carrie, watch for Early.	What are you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about you?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bri'.	Where's Adele?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Need a hand with those bags?	No, thanks, I can manage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?	...Brian hurt his foot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...never?	No, never. Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Early, just think...	Shut your mouth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.	Everybody just shut up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old you?	17.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever had anal intercourse?	Yes.
With how many people?	Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Were they wearing condoms?	Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	Was up bitch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	You fucked it?
<EOC>	<EOC>

So really, it's good luck.	Good luck?

Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.	Shut the fuck up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much you gonna take?	I don't know. How much do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
About ten. Fifteen is good.	Fifteen for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?	Yeah probably.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.	You are?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nah.	Why not? You stink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man we fucked him up.	Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sup then? Sup?	Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sup. Sup.	Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.	Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.	Right now?
Yeah. Come on.	Hold on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.	Is it cold?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I've been thinking about you lately.	You have?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.	At the block party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was lookin' for you all day today.	You were?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like kissing me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm nervous.	Trust me. Don't be nervous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?	Fine Fidget. What's all this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Bang up stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Telly is at Steven's?	I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old are you?	15.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?	One.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever had anal intercourse?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.	What?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...	I tested positive?
I'm sorry.	But I only had sex with Telly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The pain. The fucking pain!	And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.	I know.
Did you bleed?	I didn't bleed.
You didn't?	No, I didn't bleed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.	Foreplay. Foreplay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like where are your erogenous zones?	Mine?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wish me luck.	Good luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.	Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm coming.	No. I just gotta go find him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.	I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!	That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yep.	Because he can like climax you up to that...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you don't get shit out of it.	Have you ever swallowed it before?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So that's why Casper is how he is.	Oh god. That's horrible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yep.	Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi mom.	Hi Telly. Where you been?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom.	Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.	When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.	Four-thirty in the morning?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	It's me. Telly.
Hello?	Paul it's Telly. Open up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Slow.	It's grandmother style.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	It's very monotonous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By yourself?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Casual.	Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?	You are!  I don't like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morpheus.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you crazy?	Let's see how much he wants to play.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.	Maybe you should.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got it on the board.	No, I need the original note.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not talking about himself.	Then what's he talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then let's narrow it down.	Homesearchers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes you are.	Get off me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The message!  I figured out--	Sit down!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it easy.  Both of you.	I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	Anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	It's a voice modulator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.	But a hundred men could move him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!	He was with me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll find the evidence.	You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Peter.	Just a second.  Hello?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know where you are.	Very good.  How did you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nope.  Nothing.	Set up some pieces on the big board?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It worked out alright, didn't it?	Fuck off!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must be Erica.	Uh huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like my dad?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  Nice meeting you.	Nice meeting you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, dad.	My cheering section.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, dad?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It isn't Kathy.	Who's Kathy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?	Bingo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Same as the others?	Yeah.
How long she been dead?	I'd say at least eighteen hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm busy right now.	It's important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see you're still having problems with your openings.	And this Jeremy--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.	That's a big area to cover.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time did he get there?	About a quarter to one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.	What does that mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another one?  What word did he leave?	"""Is"".  Did you tell him about the institute?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you last night?	Are we going to go through this again?
Answer the question.	I went out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeremy would have never killed himself.	Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a good play, but risky.	You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have something you want to say?	Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?	Whatever's on your mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see here?	Mate in five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.	It's alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this your first time here?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I think I've had enough.	Getting too hot in here for you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you looking for?	Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you don't want to eat something?	I don't think I could.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	You're not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know you didn't	You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?	No.
Why?	Because I think he's wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?	No.  But I'm open to distractions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just don't want to fight with you.	Then show me who you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm hungry.	Call room service.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine.	What do you want on it?
You.	Would you settle for pepperoni?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you call?	The line was busy.  I'll try again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Can I come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This letter.  I've never opened it.	Why not?
Because I know what it says.	Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"How did you know it was ""carefully""?"	Frank told me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're right.  The killer told me.	He didn't tell you either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going to be late for your match.	Are you going to come tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You beat him.	I got lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.	Never mind my ears! Go away!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I lied.	About what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...	Colwyn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colwyn ...	You must move away from the Center.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will your power outward.	I don't know how.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take the western passage.	All directions are the same here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the Arctic ice.	That way. I can feel the cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a better one.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is nothing.	Reach out farther. Call to her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You choose these?	Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't reach her.	What do you see?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She must make a glaive.	Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The spiral begins in the west.	Where the spiral begins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Slayers!	We must enter the swamp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do not let the waters touch you.	What will happen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They can be saddled.	You have done it?
I road them often in my youth.	Saddles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is today?	Yes. It is today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Each to his fate.	Each to his fate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know the cruelty of such a fate.	Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I not worth returning to?	Yes.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?	Yes.
Even by you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You too are lonely.	I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.	I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.	I cannot betray my bride.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.	You will not, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Once is enough, thank you.	He saved our lives.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And where do you lead, boy?	To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.	That I promise you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you last sleep, boy?	I'm all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not hungry.	Not sleepy, either?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could reach it on fire-mares.	Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.	At the gallop!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.	Would you settle for a boar?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A venison pie as big as a house.	A small house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quell?	I cannot go with you, my friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My heart stays here.	And mine goes with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm hungry.	Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put me down, you lout!	You had better manners as a pig.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my poor stew!	Oh, my poor stomach.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't hold the weight of both of you!	Hush!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.	Look at its insides.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll trample him to death!	No. He will master the leader.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.	Then look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a lie!	These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!	Then he will die!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He will come for me.	He will not come. You will be my queen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were attacked in the forest?	Yes. We lost five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you see?	Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knowledge I wouldn't want.	No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Few have survived it.	Fewer will survive them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.	It is not necessary. They will not follow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kegan!	It is too late. He has drunk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who speaks that name!	Ynyr!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do not try your trickery on me!	It is no trickery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me his name, I will mail him.	OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.	Yeah... How do you know it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take...	Well, I don't need them...
<EOC>	<EOC>
OK, I'm fine.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rocket launcher.	Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow! It's brilliant!	Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who'll I aim at?	Whoever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The fat man down there, on the bench.	Perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The yellow and pink.	OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.	Yes, yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's incredible! How did you do it?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.	OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mathilda? May I come in?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I go to the cinema?	No.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!	No, you can't go out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not taken.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm going to kiss you.	Mathilda, stop, please!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too big.	Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!	Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...No...	...Don't you like me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I ask you a personal question?	...Yes.
What do you do, with the money you earn?	Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?	Yeah, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How shall we get out now, Leon?	Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! I don't want to leave you!!	Mathilda, listen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't fear.	I have no fear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you, Miss?	Fine...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...OK... Good.	Can I sit on the stairways now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?	Messina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Who sent you?	Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he still alive?	Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?	No... Dino's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever been in Messina, son?	Yes... Twice.
"Did you fish in Messina? The ""pesce spada""?"	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Salute.	Salute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you recognize him?	...Even his mother wouldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He probably just went somewhere.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you two planning kids?	Maybe later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to finish first.	I won't let you die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mine.	Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	The flowers... they're beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You thought I sent them?	There was no card.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you polish that thing all the time?	You're talking to me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do love you... very, very much.	Show me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walk with me?	You like to take walks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.	Please tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought we both wanted the same things.	I've changed my mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want children.	You've just decided, is that right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	I think it's a different place for each person.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know where my heaven is.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The beach of Pacifica, California.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To where?	Pacifica, California.
From where?	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!  He jumped!	Jumped where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, hello.	I'm Isaac... I'm three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your parents would want you to be in bed.	You tell stories?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Each inch represents 150 miles...	Making the grand total?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This story is big huh?	Mammoth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?	Yes.
Where?	California.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When are you leaving?	Tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm walking there Kris.	Walking where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're walking to California?	Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.	So I've been informed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tom Joad?	... The Grapes of Wrath.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they standing?	Saluting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on Mr. Parker.	What, come on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are a lot of people worried about you.	Where am I?
In a hospital.	Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do your friends call you?	Steph.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning.	Good morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it a boy or a girl?	Oh, that's not mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your shoe size?	What?  Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've always wanted a watch like that.	It's yours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I really want that watch.	This isn't right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello!	Hello.
Are you working?	Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sarah -- with an H?	No -- S.E.R.A.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I use the bathroom?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a drink? I'm having one.	A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to fuck now?	Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...	To death?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If I was I'm sorry.	No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is the home of an angel.	You OK out there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you like me, Ben?	Don't be silly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sera... what you don't understand is...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ben?	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that all about?	Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.	Can we just ignore it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please!	Yes... I'll give you that.
Thank you, Sera.	Do you want me not to go tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like it here with you.	Let's stay for a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are limits.	Yes... I guess I knew that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I love you... yeah?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have been lonely?	I've been all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have been lonely?	I am lonely, Yuri.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is, after all, Sera, my money.	Yes, of course. How much do you need?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes? What?	It's me, Yuri.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you told anyone that I'm here?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you with another man?	Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.	Are we done for today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.	Who could better understand than me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's so shameful...	Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dewey Newcomb?	Who's askin'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.	That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get it?	Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good work today, Ms. Woods.	Thank you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're hitting on me?	You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --	I'm a man who knows what I want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going up there.	Yes, I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.	See?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Aristotle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- his life?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't even imagine.	Spill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ready?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, that felt great!	Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.	Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.	Relation?
I'm her sister.	Name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.	You know her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our group is full.	Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You almost had me fooled.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a bitch.	Yes, you are.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.	Yes, he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We still love you. Sisters forever!	Thank you. I love you, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here. You're gonna need this.	Your scrunchie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck.	Thanks again for your help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ask.	I wasn't gonna --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?	My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.	How do you figure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?	No, she can't move for an hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?	We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really think I'm attractive?	For a butt-head? Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gay! Enrique is gay!	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back up. How do you know he's gay?	Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey --	I'm quitting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God!	Oh, my God!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone missed you.	Is he the only one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, he is so over on this campus.	I just don't understand what went wrong --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!	What, like on va-kay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?	Absolutely!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Neither.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes? Ms. Woods?	I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did?	You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
I don't know --	You should. Do you have a resume?
<EOC>	<EOC>
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.	Maybe she found him like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't really believe she's innocent?	Of course, I do!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Class schedule, map, book list.	Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're beautiful.	So are you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon. Let me take you home.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good. Good.	Do anything exciting?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look -- nice.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pink ones.	See?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
In court. On opposing sides.	Are you serious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elle?	Where's the Rock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it a Kappa?	It's not a Theta --
<EOC>	<EOC>
There he is!	Pull up next to him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why so few?	Faith.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You go?  Not watch fun?	I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We watch... good fun...	Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn you!	We're both of us damned, my beauty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.	What do you want from me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's bluebells!	What!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.	Better we eat him than the other way round.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Something's coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pregnant, is she?	It would appear so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn them!	Careful, lad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worse than the battlefield.	What know you of fields of war?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.	Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God!  Look!	Something the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should hope not!	Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God's blessing.	There's the way, mates.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What make ye of that, Jack?	It bodes evil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait!	Willful creature, that one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait, Jack.	Nay.  This time we strike first!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we trust him?	No... but what choice have we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never felt so cold in all me born days...	The chill is worse this night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One more turn...	That's it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?	Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.	Fire away!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.	Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye.  We're good as inside.	It's what we'll find there worries me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you explain what's going on?	Patience, lad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!	Never show mercy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ride like wild fire, Jack.	He'll not escape me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.	Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barely living, from the looks of it.	No, no, no... this is different!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see!  You see!	These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We seek to undo the curse.	Gonna make ogre-stew!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done, lad.	Three cheers for our champion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweet slippers of Oisin!	They've fired the moat!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye... my Lord...	Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're these?	They'll do nicely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dolt!	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These for me?	If you like.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promised!	Never.
But you did... you did!	I may have said perhaps...
Liar!	Or perchance...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	To fetch your napkin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lili!  No!	Jack... Forgive me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have I done?	Only what's right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were dead... I --	I was bewitched... it's better this way...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Step lively now!	His feet shall never cross my lips.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Courage, Jack.	I pray God grants it me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not the time for squabbling.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do now?	We wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's she doing?	I think she's about to foal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm in your debt, Screwball.	Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Praise be to God.	Small miracles better than no miracles...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	Up ahead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What care the bones when the soul is free?	Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, Jack.	It's done... we'll never catch him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How came you by this blade?	I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhm... fine work.	Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're with us in battle.	May God protect you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...	I'm sending you back to Hell!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let that be our problem, just get us there.	You follow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marco!	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad's disappeared!	He was there and then he wasn't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going to see Sam again?	I thought I might stop by.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you know him before you knew Dad?	Since seventh grade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not there.	He's here.  Check the bathroom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When does George get to come see his house?	It's so beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that for?	Mom said I should.
Oh.	I would have anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hasn't called?	Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you guys feel like painting?	What color?
Red.	I love red!  That's my favorite color!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom?	Here, honey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I put him to work.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I couldn't get it to go down.	And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.	You'd better call and cancel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing up so early?	I couldn't sleep last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?  What do you mean?	Uh...using Josh like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to bed.	Has he eaten anything at all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Atonement.	Who are all these people?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry I got you into trouble.	I'll survive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you have school?	Nope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's today?	Monday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My keys.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to ask like that?	I want you to try something with me, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My mother would die.	Let's shut up and not kill her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not what I was expecting.	What did you think it would be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should stay.	I don't know.
Where's your dad?	He jumped into the ocean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you remember me from when you lived here?	Yeah.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.	Really?
I wanted him to marry her.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	I can use your mom's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the point of this?	Does everything have to have a point?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure you're totally into guys?	What are you talking about?
Josh said...	I'm not gay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On the handlebars or your shoulders?	Are you afraid of heights?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you?!	Floating to Catalina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.	He's got a standing invitation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He won't leave my room.	Will he talk to me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And of course the Beck's, with the...	It could have been a squirt gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you guys' friends?	We've known each other since grade school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Stevens?	I've been dreading you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate to ask about a window.	I flushed it down the toilet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?	If that's what it takes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That would take weeks.	Months.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been here twenty years.	Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?	That's too long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got one favor to ask.	What can I do for you, George?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Alyssa home?	She's out with a friend.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?	She didn't really say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sam?	Uh huh.
I didn't recognize you!	I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.	Not a shower.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the shower.	I want you both to stay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.	Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If she's not up, you can use my shower.	Thank you.
You're here early today.	We're getting out of the ground today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Alyssa here?	It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I forgot where I put my keys.	And you thought they might be under her dress?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.	To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.	Why would you be there?
Because I live there.	You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not going!	You don't have a choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you totally insane?!	I almost saw Catalina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably in the bible.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?!	I warned you yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate turkey.	No you don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm leaving.	Hey...hey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I don't know.
When are you going to be back?	I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.	Oh, okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it?	A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?	I might have a solution.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Alyssa.	Hi, Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I took some of your Vicodin.	I know.  Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I loved him too much.	After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.	That's so weird...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you told Mom today?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't wanna go, Sam.	Here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd eat a lot of red meat.	Good for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What would you do?	I'd build a house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of house?	You know what mortise and tenon is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good for you.	I haven't been touched in years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah!  Oh....	I know there's an explanation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many bedrooms will your house have?	Three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just wanted to know where Mom was?	Oh.  Sorry.
It's okay.	She needs to be alone, I think.
Because Dad left?	She's a little sad, is all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should lock your doors.	Ring the bell before you try the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lock the door behind you.	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	He doesn't answer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He never answers.	Why does he have a lock on his door?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, hey!	I'm married.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did say he could go.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.	Well, for later then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been wrong a lot in my life.	Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
<EOC>	<EOC>
With your hands or your tongue?	You're not well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you'd be up with the sun.	My stupid back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you need help?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's been a while.	This was my very first slow dance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's see if you've gotten any better.	Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought we were helping.	I can hire workers to help me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm married.	You bit my finger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's not do this, okay?	I need to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back.  Neck.  Back.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could die.	So could I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going to kiss me?	It's not my back that's killing me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't move!	I'm an idiot to have you up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I better get the kids home.	Not a perfect day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Been thinking?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.	Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.	You got any weed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.	I could use the money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He said he heard hammering.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've eaten.	Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To shave your chest?	We should take a vacation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The biggest waste of time since television.	Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was talking about our marriage.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?	What are you doing home?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never really trusted me.	You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Despite you.	I never asked for more.
That's the problem.	Please don't leave me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are the kids?	Sam took them to a movie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Take it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't look like you.	Either do you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey.
You got a dog?	It's not ours.  It's George's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've missed you guys.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know anything about building a house?	No.
I guess I could teach you some things.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing in my room?	I didn't go in your room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The door was open.	I don't know what I'm doing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Queer.	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All day again?	Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?	Can we really help build a house?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I brought a few of my own.	Someone stop her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam, that's not true!	Yes, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing R, okay?	Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go tell your father we're eating.	Dad's home, already?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A night in the hole?	Better make it a week.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's 1945. It's a different world now.	Not for me, it ain't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I trust you, Claude.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.	Goodnight, Claude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?	Sure, boss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got it... boss.	He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!	Here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comfortable?	As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.	But I'm having a good time...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never seen you in here before.	That's because I've never been here before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said you're soft.	Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright. You want some pie?	Yeah, I want some pie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think he's hurt pretty bad.	He's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.	Winston. His name's Winston.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This fork is filthy.	The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.	Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Ray, time to go!	I'm stuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.	We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a pardon from the governor.	Let me see that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.	Make 'em throw strikes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing?	Don't touch that car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I'm gonna kill him --	No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't do it.	That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?	I said you're soft.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?	He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't eat this.	Why the hell not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.	You didn't get ketchup?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?	Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know you're not talking to me...	I'm sorry, he's on medication...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.	I try to moisturize regularly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got your own nightclub?	Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!	Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?	No problem. Oh, boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why ain't his pick swinging?	Why ain't that pick swinging?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All in, boss!	Move it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where am I at, man?	C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, the dude's holdin'.	Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.	What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mama?	Rayford!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.	Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?	Something like that, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.	Like you shot Winston Hancock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Apparently, your sister died.	Jenny?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Appreciate it.	Anybody else need anything read?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	Satchmo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.	Greenville, that the nearest town?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?	That's a long story...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the Boom Boom Room?	That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.	You found him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?	Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ADRIAN!	You shouldn't have come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.	He's sick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now will you get in the flask?	Absolutely not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what I thought!	Could you concentrate for five seconds?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?	What do you think about... Earth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	Don't do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?	Noon...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll call her later.	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All these good people have totally been led astray.	Show him Central Park.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come you're not older?	Angels don't get any older, son.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Valerie's crying!	She's so nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you just talk?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he? He's late.	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So far, so good. Now what?	Put it in your mouth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is baloney!	"He superimposed your head onto ""Scarface."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knock, knock.	Yes, Jimmy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?	Metallica, Dad. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a good devil, Dad.	And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is bad, Nicky.	How bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. This can't be happening.	Son, just do your best.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bus?	Beast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, I was the one who created Hell.	I know, your wickedness.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No wonder your uncle's so weird...	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy, Liberace.	Oh, would you grow up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.	Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.	'Bout time...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's with that guy?	Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you check out the dragon mouth?	The Dark Prince is here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look who's back from the dead.	Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you're down with this?	Little nervous. Wanna puke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looking for the chief.	We know where to find Nicky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Schnapps...	Peppermint... alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way did he go?	That way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. One more time.	Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please. You got to.	All right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good idea... kill me.	Dude. Seriously?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta kill yourself.	I'll just go to Heaven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adrian?	Andrew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got the wrong window again, man.	Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's freezing my hands.	It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.	What was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to Jersey?	East Rutherford.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it.	I have to, Valerie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nicky!	That was Cassius!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do me.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is that funny?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks like the work of a brother...	A black guy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey...	See something you like, my man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!	No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?	Anything to eat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you think we got here??!!	You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you think we came from?	From? From? From?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you want us?	Up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have anything special in mind?	I don't care... Just get it over with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Had enough?	Even the alarm didn't wake him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Just wondered... what happens?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You missed something special.	Well... you can't have them all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who invited you?	I'm in my party mood.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on, Logan?!	It has nothing to do with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?	Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?	I'm very smart.
When do you go up?	I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, Available?	Please... No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What Quad do you live in?	K.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could have called me yourself.	But I wasn't sure you'd come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get that?	A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?	I let him go... believe me.
I don't..	Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
Please? What friends?	I don't have much time.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...	And I never heard of Sanctuary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you here to help me?	What do you need?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you going to do?	That's tomorrow.
I wish I could help you.	Maybe you'll think of something...
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you did know, you'd tell me.	Of course --
If you trusted me, you'd know.	We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.	You're not going, are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd rather be with you.	That's nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you take me with you?	Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do we know this is the right way?	It's the only way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid.	It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate outside! I hate it!	We'll be all right...  We will...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't!	Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?	I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.	I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It all seemed to make sense until Box.	Do you think he was telling the Truth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does it mean?	The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beloved husband...	Beloved wife...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?	Yes...
Are you sure?	Mother and Father said so... you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What belongs to the people?	All this. All of it.
What people?	I don't know... but it does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll have to bury him.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll make the arrangements.	At least it's over...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come with us.	Where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye.	Oh, my...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Sandman.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have you been living here?	For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?	Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you get here?	I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?	Gracious... no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they?	Dead... they're dead... and buried.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's beyond this place -- do you know?	No, no, no
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?	Never, never, ever. Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready to put him in?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.	Alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?	More... many more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.	Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Just goin' up'ta ""Tops""... Maybe the ""Ten Pin""."	"Sheila'll be at ""Tops""."
Sure, what's wrong with that?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want somethin'?	No, I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happenin'?	They're comin' with us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay, man?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pete... You okay?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm, okay... You okay?	Sure, I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a musician?	Yes, I thought my wife...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like to remember things my own way.	What do you mean by that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very strange.	What is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you own a video camera?	No. Fred hates them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Maid? Relative?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll keep a watch on the house.	As best we can.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You recognize that guy?	Yeah... Laurent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a fuckin' job.	His or ours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.	You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?	There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was here yesterday.	Yeah, I remember.
How would you like to take me to dinner?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.	Over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pete?	Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll kill us.	Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.	So what do we do?
I don't know.	We should stop seeing each other.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you partied with him?	I used to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, should I call Andy?	Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.	Yeah. Call him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you my man?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got him.	Alice, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	We killed him.
You killed him.	Alice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the bathroom?	Up the stairs - down the hall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?	Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.	Do ya good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Sit down a minute.
What's up?	Sit down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please tell me.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His condition? What do you mean?	His physical condition.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.	Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Pete?	Out in back.
You talk to him?	No... Here he comes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We saw you that night, Pete.	You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One of the guards must have leaked it.	What's the word on the street?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just gonna let him go?	We'll get a tail put on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not Fred Madison?	No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?	I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Yeah, Mack?	Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?	Pete, what happened to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you remember?	No... I don't. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Nothin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We know that.	Who was the man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	He won't give his name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this, Rogoff?	I don't know yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not Madison?	Not even close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHAT DID YOU SAY?	I... I didn't say anything...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your axe?	Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's bothering you, Madison?	The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Alice?	Alice who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?	What are you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It must be from a real estate agent.	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had a dream about you last night...	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Sheila?!	No... I really don't want to talk about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you like me?	I do like you, Sheila.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
All of it?	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes, sir.	I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two years!?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Lovey.	I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.	Good morning
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they? Do you see them?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Sounds like a stall to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. You know.	Horns? What kind of horns?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are!	This doesn't obligate me in any way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charming chap.	Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that's that, I guess.	Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we going to do?	Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chalmers Bryant!	Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, what's happened to you?	Nothing. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cave, eh? Where?	Over by that hill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey - look!	Look, Bob!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And mine's Conway.	How do you do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
By the way, what religion do you follow here?	We follow many.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. I'm afraid it does.	Shall we have another?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you taking me?	Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bob, these are all that are left.	Come on! Quick! This way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just what I needed too.	You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are these people?	I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it? Has he fainted?	It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's dead.	Dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
George, what do you think you're doing?	Let me go, Bob!
<EOC>	<EOC>
George, come back!	Chang! Chang! Chang!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me up! Let me up!	All right. Sorry, George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the porters?	Porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?	Why - I'm sorry - but I
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you come from?	I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.	What if he refuses?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.	Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
<EOC>	<EOC>
At the mercy of a mad pilot.	We'd be eternally grateful if you
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm thirty.	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.	Bump?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to wring my little neck?	I'd love it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, he's speaking English.	English!
<EOC>	<EOC>
EXCUSE ME	Please don't go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The hell happened?	Hesitated, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...touch that.	What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.	I guess I lost:
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.	And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.	I gotta be honest about something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only the damn guy won't know it.	What happens if I say no?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which do you have your money on, Dee?	I'd go with number three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Helluva night, isn't it?	Yup.  Sure is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll take it from here.	What?  Who the hell are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a bug.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like a train ticket.	Where to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	Get back in the car!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ...	We're rising.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?	The Pentagon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."""	I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.	What if he's telling the truth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Since how long?	Since as long as we've been keeping records...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's marble.	All of it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you call this a code 100?	I'd double it and add 20.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!	Kay!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were saying?	Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.	You know, there's something we never really thought of...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right, right-- I like that stuff.	With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.	Do have any idea what I just said?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...	You figured what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And I'm arranging deportation papers.	Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.	You're not taking me in!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need to talk to you about the alien.	The what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really nice wheels, by the way.	Wait-- listen--
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's Dee?	Fine.  Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.	So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gone, too.	What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're gone.	Dee?  What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting a trajectory...	What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And they're buying it?	They went right to the President.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it wasn't in the jar...	Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...	Oh shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wally!	Can you see?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	They're inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it.	Agatha...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agatha --	Can you see the balloon man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drop some money.	Forget that guy --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Follow him.	He'll turn around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agatha...	Wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's here.	Anderton, leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't.  I have to know.	Please --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, God...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not alive, but she didn't die.	Oh, Jesus...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.	What --
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- but he didn't.	Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.	Found?  Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?	Because I found out about her...
About who?	Anne Lively...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not much.	It's all I could safely move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't remember me, do you?	We know each other?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hence the expression...	... Graveyard shift.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.	Try again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.	Lara --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me not to worry, John.	Don't worry, Lamar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John.  Please.  Listen to me --	I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --	Everybody runs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.	No doubt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't grab it...	Run the subscription list...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somewhere near the capital?	No maglev system.
The mall?	Georgetown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead.	Did he close the front door?
What?	Did Marks close the front door?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red Ball?	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.	That was easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Confirm with trig and image.	Any ID on the shooter yet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you catch that?	Because it was going to fall.
You're certain?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.	You gonna tell on me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wally, listen to me...	Do I know you?  Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just go to the beginning!	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you reading my mind right now?	Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop --	Tell me how.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?  Where's the rest?	I guess that's all of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rufus, play it back...	Uh, I'll try...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I scored a goal!	That's great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won!	What a big boy.  How old are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	I'm your son.  I'm you.
Sean, wait...	Hold your breath, Dad...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know who I am?	Some -- somebody's father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not gonna kill me?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you have to.  They said you would.	The precogs were wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let go of the gun.	You're not gonna kill me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something wrong?	I'm a little dizzy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do I even know which one has it?	It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?	The female.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's insanity around here.	I thought you were retiring?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The guy from USA Today is here.	Tell him not now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --	Not.  Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, the press conference is starting.	I'll be right there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, sir.	My God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have an emergency call on your private line.	Thank you.  This is Burgess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good God.  What was that?	Wait, just a second...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the same prevision.	Not quite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So there is a way to fool the system?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Evanna, the team pilot.	Nice to meet you.  Gum?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't they shut that off?	That's the Red Ball Alarm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.	Yes, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't matter.  He wins.	We can stop him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about your meeting?	I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Raincheck?	Sure.  Raincheck.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --	I know who you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This your work?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Since right after we lost our son.	You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.	But John was with him at the pool?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to meet you, Wally.	Shhh!  They're sleeping.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?	No thank you.

Ricky's not wearing one.	Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, baby?	He's not doing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not my daddy.	You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey?	Where were you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.	Yeah? You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take her.	What'd you say?

Any time, bro.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry coach.	Sorry coach.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? Did she say something?	She wants you to paint the ashtray.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.	Who's driving her?
I don't know.	This paint sucks. The white shows through.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right here's fine.	Is that the woman from..?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.	That's
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colonel!	You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Has he been here?	No.
Have you seen him?	I ain't seen him for a week.

<EOC>	<EOC>

I hate fucking Springfield.	Is that where you're family lives?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the car?	I need to get something straight first.
<EOC>	<EOC>

What?!	You want a convertible or hardtop?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Manual or automatic?	Automatic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold on a second here.	Is there a problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Roper.	Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything on Korda so far?	Solis said to keep you clear of this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you in charge, Roper?	Yep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Satisfied?	Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all there.	Spread it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?	If you say so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever been in a hostage situation?	Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.	Like it had to be done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It rarely has to be done.	I've rarely shot anyone.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are we gonna get him out of there?	We could fill it with water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. Let's go for a drink.	I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.	Well, if I have to, I have to.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Ronnie... Yeah, so.	Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.	I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm just practicing my lying.	Still needs work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The 6 horse is last.	That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?	To run late!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The 6 horse is still last.	He'll be running at the quarter pole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They need to run first and second?	Yeah, first and second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!	The jockey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We won!	We lost.
We won.	How much you wanna bet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long you been coming here?	About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?	Occasionally you lose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's your answer. He's smart.	He's cutting down the visibility.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's got the girl.	Damnit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know how you feel, Ray.	You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.	I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. I'm sorry.	Can I come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wanted to get this out of the way.	You got a bet on the game tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?	It's okay. We broke up.
When?	Just now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like this place?	It's very nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	...Let me just show you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Korda escaped.	And you think he'll...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.	I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scottie, Scottie...	It's all over, babe, it's all over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay here, don't move.	Scottie...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scottie?	Hmm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You crazy? With all those people around?	Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
The hell I am!	Prude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...	I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Repoed this morning.	I'll provide you with transportation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are these yours?	Yeah, they are but...
<EOC>	<EOC>
God-Damn you!	Yes, I believe he has --
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay.	Okay...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	To live forever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you believe in miracles?	I'm serious, how did you know my name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were right.	About what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?!	Someone who believes in miracles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all here...	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The guests are here.	Guests?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But this is impossible.	That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	Nothing, go back to sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's time to wake up.	Wake up?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.	True.  But why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Divinity?	Yes.
You are not a God.	In here I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were the one who was dying.	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell are you going?	Unfinished business.
And what about the reconfiguration?	Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure he's going to come?	It's his nature.
But what if he doesn't --	-- He will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long 'till we can eject?	We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?	At least a day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you plugged-in from?	New York.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	The weather.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Won't be time if he gets access --	-- He won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He had access to the keys --	-- Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One condition.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he tell you?	The truth.
Not his style.	Katie was digitized.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then you had her killed.	Why would I do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.	Try harder.
There was no need to kill her.	Then where is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
An interface attendant.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need the disk back!	Insurance.
Insurance?	If she's alive, you get it back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What brings you inside?	Cleaning up a mess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got to get back.	Tanner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone you have to get back to?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You went to my high-school?	No.
Then how do you know about --	-- You told me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.	Who are you?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.	That's not possible.  No one can do that.

Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.	From your mouth ta God's ear.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.	Who hired the bastard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't even a man yet.	That ain't what your mama said.

When he first came in to the sleep lab?	Yeah...before your time.

You sure this is...medically advisable?	Got a doctor on duty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?	Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.	Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.	I'd better go report this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stu?	Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.	Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	My <u>tail</u> itches.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.	Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go. Just <u>go</u>.	Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--

Oh, let me get out of your way then.	What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there something else I can do for you?	Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
You want to come inside?	Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.

Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?	Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.	Page boys!

Pixilated.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, you own it, Longfellow.	Yes, you own it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.	Always.

Oh, yes.	Yes, indeedy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's still pixilated.	He sure is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fainted.	Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thank you. I'll be all right.	Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.	You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What?	Oh - uh - nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure. I met you.	Oh. What's happening about the opera?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen the papers?	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's Times Square.	You can almost spit on it, can't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's a nice place.	Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.	I'm from a small town too, you know.
Really?	Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, if it isn't too late.	I'll get my hat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.

Would you like to read it? It's to you.	Yes, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Mary?	Oh, hello darling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, hon?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a fool, Babe.	I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a minute. No, you don't.	We're not going out tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!	It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Did it?	I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, come on!	Hurry up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.	Boy, was he burning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow! My foot's asleep!	Come on - let's go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.	Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You try it.	Me, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit over there, will you?	Me sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't come up here!	Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!	I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!	Let me go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank heaven.	Better wire him right away, John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Bennett please!	This is outrageous!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's what?	What was that you said he was?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your Honor, I object.	Proceed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a lie!	Mr. Cedar!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.	But your honor
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't find him.	You can't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?	Yes.
How do you do.	How do you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like to ask you a few questions.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?	Who - me? No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you have a cigar?	No, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?	Is Mr. Deeds in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This afternoon - at four o'clock.	I don't think we've got any suitcases.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have a drink?	No, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.	What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.	Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Chairman?	Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?	Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We provide opera.	But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?	You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No - I don't want it, thank you.	Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, he's temperamental.	Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your Honor	Yes?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.	Take the stand!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-huh.	I write poetry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brookfield just came in.	Oh, the poet? Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are they?	I don't know.

Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.	Thank you so much. Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, sir.	Excuse me. What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]	Prairie? Oysters?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please!	But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, did you hear that?	What, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, that's an echo, sir!	You try it.
Me, sir?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I call the police, sir?	No!  What do you want!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.	Hmm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Mumford.	Mr. Cook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What an asshole!	Ernest, what do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing for lunch?	Right now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your wife, Henry?	Go to hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was... never satisfied.	Now we're back on track.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	You are so mean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	It's a thought I had.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?	My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.	Doc. Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're the doctor, what do you think?	She seems very unhappy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...	Oh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.	Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You do?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?	My patient had to leave early.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?	You like me. How come?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.	Doc.  Ainge...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.	It's a pleasure to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...so rich?	...so accomplished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doc...	Lily.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!	And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.	Thanks for your help, Lionel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you know how to drive?	Sure.
Got a license?  But no car?	Don't need it.
I just got my license two weeks ago.	You're good.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.	That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?	I'm trying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with her?	Is she a friend of yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiya, Doc.	Martin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.	Mumford... like the town?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.	Mother... go away!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ph.D., psychologist.	Oh... not a real doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you want?	There's something I think we need to talk about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finally, some common sense...	What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.	No, I really don't.
I think you do.	Why don't you tell me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow. You're something.	Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, look who's here...	Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?	Could I see Sofie, please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not making any promises.	We'll turn back anytime you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please... forgive me.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this the treatment?	Sorry... I'm done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.	Be specific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sore throat?	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?	Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can give myself a headache instantly.	Is that like a party trick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was really bad, wasn't it?	Disgusting.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing	It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother...	What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...How violated I feel?	You're not the only one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...but first, you have to tell me something...	Anything... just ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got off easy.	Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.	Will you be here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.	What do you want me to see?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think you know what you're talking about.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.	How are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like another beer?	Nah... scotch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I ask you a personal question?	Of course! That's exactly what I want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	This --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --	-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!	Jerking off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Skip, that's not much of a secret.	It's not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who else knows?	Just you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn! What is your name?	Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've told you a lot of private stuff.	I can tell you anything else.
<EOC>	<EOC>
At least you pulled yourself out...	Things got a lot worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.	See you Thursday... regular time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lily.	Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry...	Wow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doc!... It's not me, is it?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know where he's taking her?	Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the hell are these guys?	Priests. Imhotep's priests.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never killed a priest before.	They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now go find me a big stick.	In the desert? What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!	None of the above, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's make us even, shall we?	Even?
<EOC>	<EOC>
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!	Sounds familiar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.	I've had worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon, friend.	Why do you like to fight so much?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your new friend?	What friend? You're my only friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Oh yes, always.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.	What is he doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?	To have stopped this creature? Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.	You will not believe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!	Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The sun turning black.	Water turning to blood.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You bastards!	What did you do to him!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they taking him?	To be hanged.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No women allowed.	I am an English woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lie.	I would never!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A bright good morning to all.	What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So who's the broad?	Broad?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?	Because that's where I found it. I was there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were actually at Hamunaptra?	I just decked your brother
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Really want to know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !	Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know your history.	I know my treasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.	Oh that's comforting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're almost there.	Are you sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
For what?	We're about to be shown the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.	Preparation for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.	You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two!	You don't believe in curses, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.	No you're not.
I'm not?	Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?	Because that's my name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!	The creature!? Are you sure!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it!	Got what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it, Evelyn.	I have no choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got guts, lady.	Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You...! YOU...!	Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you no respect for the dead?	Right now, I only wish to join them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jonathan?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But he's just a filthy criminal?	Way to go, Evy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this	Still...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you suppose killed him?	Did you ever see him eat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found it, Evy! I found it	Shut-up and get me off of here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?	Read the inscription on the cover!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finish the inscription, idiot!	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!	Yes,... I see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's my sister, actually.	Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey,... don't I know you?	Um, well, you see...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That thing gives me the creeps.	Be nice. That thing saved my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.	And it stinks to high heaven in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's my gun?	What are you going to do? Shoot him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!	That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's here!?	The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.	And then he'll be coming after Evy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!	You have got to be joking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything's going exactly as we planned.	Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.	Your mind is so slippery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Head hunting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing all alone in the dark?	Fantasizing... about you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were done?	One last tweak.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our guests are waiting.	I'll be down in a jiffy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We didn't think this through very well.	My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was the last time I saw him.	When was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Much less go outside.	Then Captain Amazing appeared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could really use some coffee --	And some sandwiches --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, baby!	Do it, big boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Atta, girl!	Atta, boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, do I look like a Man?	Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	I'm the Bowler.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.	He was cute though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about... the Savage Six?	The Inscrutable Six?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's late. I'm headin' home.	Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No one will believe us.	They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds good to me.	Let's do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?	I thought you'd never ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.	Half a Dirty Dozen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mon Captain, it's for you.	Hello?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey... you okay?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes!	Doctor Heller?
Yes!	It's me... Elizabeth.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!	Thanks.
How's your dad?	He's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Snap out of it!	Get on to yourself!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll never make it.	Think positive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Superheroes.	Should I kill them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That boy's got talent.	And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do with Captain Amazing?	Captain who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.	You're dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And the light goes out...	Frankenstein!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.	They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you an actress?	Just a waitress.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	I thought you'd chickened out on me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"How 'bout giving me ""the tour""?"	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's the artist?	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come here.	I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?	Curiosity.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd better go.	You're a spy.
What?	I saw him walk you home.
Who?	Roy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay away!	Or you'll what? CAN ME?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or talk?	Not tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Alone tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's me.	Monica, where are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.	Good or evil, what's the difference?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're the Sphinx.	And you are a fool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You drink too much.	When are you going to take off that mask?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh don't start that again --	LOOK!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.	We had an off night, that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And it would be the right thing to do.	Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever seen him?	How could I see him if he's invisible?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure that's how you spell it?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what else has Superman got?	He's got the fact that he's Superman!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This place is built like a fortress.	Because that's what it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
GET MAD!	But I just don't feel it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!	Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But she still might call!	Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.	Not a chance!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cover me!	With what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.	Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.	See ya tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	Wait!... Look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm soaked.  Oh great.	Shhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roy --	Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So where's the art?	He hasn't stolen it yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But... only when no one is looking.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're only invisible... to yourself?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Obliterators!	The Eradicators!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Firepower costs money.	Anybody got any?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Obie-wan.	Hey... he's gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys going to a costume party?	We're superheroes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you go.	Ow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeffrey!	Oh hi, Mom.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?	Looking for... the TV Guide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's on the television.	Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!	Mother... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?	Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She likes you.	Definitely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is bad.	Who are they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We may be getting in over our heads here.	This looks like a job for Superman --
Or Batman --	Or both.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't crunch the leaves.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be a Mohican.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And there's the Sphinx.	The who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And a social life.	Yeah, but how do we get to them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
To us!	Whatever our name is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure he's still lives here?	Are you sure he's still alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?	The bazookas?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.	But how do we get in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're outnumbered twenty to one.	It's suicide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no.	Great timing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's time.	With or without him, we gotta go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got lift off!	May the forks be with us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where am I going?	Through there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes -- who spoke up?	I did, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God...!  What time is it?	Four o'clock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening, sir.	Good evening, Mademoiselle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.	Oh, I'm sorry about that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could hear them?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean you heard them making love?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you say his name was?	Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come in.	Major Lavallette to see you, General.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come in.	A message from Citizen Fouche.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come in.	Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know you smoke weed, right?	Why you say that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?	I don't know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Thought he was with you.	Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me, too.  You think they're in there?	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stretch it out.	Don't move me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	I'm his cousin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We didn't come here for Day-Day.	Yes you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No I'm not.	I'll do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great moves, Day-Day.	What happen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you mean talk to her?	You know what he mean, dude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.	Not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.	That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?	Black magic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me neither.	It's something in that hydraulic pump.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's about to work, just come on.	What about the dog?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's crackin'?	You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!	Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!	I know, be still.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So.	What you mean, so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I walked.	You walked?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what this is?	Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.	Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
<EOC>	<EOC>
$247.	Okay, plan B.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I ain't trying to get in it.	You already in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You better stop running from that girl.	Fuuuuuuck -- U!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.	I don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blow.	That ain't gonna work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It works.	Still gonna smell it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?	Out the door and to the left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Craig, what the hell are you doing?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What we gonna do?	I don't know yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, Roach, see you around.	Sorry about today, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see that?	I didn't see nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope to God that dog is happy.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	Wait for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're welcome, Unc.	What about me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want us to give you a ride?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Most definitely.	Better sooner than later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did.  Is that door locked?	It's locked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.	So what?  Let's make'em wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Next time, page me first.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Delivery!	I said hold on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here I come!	Well bring yo' ass on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.	All damn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Craig, remember what I told you.	I'll remember.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see that?	I saw it.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You were saying?  Your daughter....?	I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I remember you...in the elevator.	That's right.
You were very nervous.	It was because I had this...in my pocket
<EOC>	<EOC>
This? I've never even fired one.	Indeed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.	I would also like to apologize.
For what?	For not believing you.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that something precious?	No, that's,..that's fine
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.	No! You can't! They're in on it.

I'm looking for them.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-	Young love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what happens if I don't call you?	I kill her anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's enough.	'Daddy has to go now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come Back.	Yeah.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Any trouble?	No.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.	He carried on some; kicked.

Where's your Mom?	Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here they come.	Dad, you're bleeding...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Uncle Birdie!	Don't!

Twenty-five wives!	And he killed every last one of 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothin'.	Come to me, boy!

<EOC>	<EOC>
O no! Your turn!	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About our secrets.	No.
Why, pray tell?	Because John said I mustn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?	But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?	Can I have this?

Didn't you have no inkling?	Yes; from the first night.
The first night?	Our honeymoon.
How's that?	She turned me out of the bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harry!	I was praying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get up, Willa.	Harry, what --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you through praying?	I'm through, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mornin', ladies.	How'do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.	It's about that John and that Pearl?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, John?	Didn't you hear me, boy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	Them kids!
What are you after them for?	None of your business, Madam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you all talk about?	Pearl and John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miz Cooper!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, good. She's asleep.	Thank God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god, oh my god...	Get the kit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worked like a charm.	Jesus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just a stupid cat.	Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?	Because he was scary, that's why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's going on!?	Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I did.	Haven't slept, have you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.	Uh-oh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?	Okay, okay.  I think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, it's dark in here.	Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. So?	Just checking -- keep out of sight!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whenever I get nervous I eat.	And if you can't do that, you sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing, pal?	Okay. Hi, dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rod's not a lunatic.	You got a sane explanation for what he did?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She dreamed this would happen...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Decide to take a day off after all?	Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.	Just want to talk to him a second.
He's dangerous.	You don't know he did it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...	Uh, she just saw you, sir...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who? Who did that?	Krueger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you think you're going?	School.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right home after.	Right home after. See you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.	I won't.
Get into bed.	I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Great
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take this, it'll help you sleep.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I must be going nuts...	Nancy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.	Put that damned thing down!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Screw sleep!	Nancy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's with the bars?	S'curity.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I should'n'a done it.	Just sleep now, Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never touched her.	You were screaming like crazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone else was there.	The door was locked from your side.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think I did it?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rod says the sweetest things.	He's nuts about you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to have a fire.	Really. Turn 'er up a little.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feel better now, right?	Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?	No more fights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Comrade.	Have you any money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, here are fifty francs.	Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.	Naturally, Comrade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, Ninotchka?	It's from Paris.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wouldn't like Razinin.	He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And how is Lord Lavenham?	...and little Lady Beatrice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we free, Buljanoff?	Possibly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, that's not him...	Positively not!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...	...des raisins de Madère, des framboises...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Capitalistic methods...	They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's cutting our throat...	But what can we do?... We have to accept.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't like Razinin.	We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Misha! Misha!	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That must be the one!	Yes, he looks like a comrade!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!	And they might believe her in Moscow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's be happy that we're all alive.	And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a lovely room you have here.	How many families live here with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.	Just see how happy the people look... from here....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?	No, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am Comrade Buljanoff.	Monsieur.
May I ask how much your rooms are?	Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which lawyer?	You didn't get legal advice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comrade Buljanoff...	Yes, Comrade?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?	With two f's, if you please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.	Don't worry... there will be enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is high time you got out of Russia.	I must be stern with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guest?	We have opened a restaurant...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?	Oh, yes, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Your Highness.	Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.	That's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening, Gaston.	Good evening, Monsieur.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...	Go to bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your breakfast, monsieur.	I don't feel like any breakfast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.	That's perfect!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this satisfactory?	Thank you, Louis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can call our ambassador.	I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Leon...	What is it, my boy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leon, my little boy.	Oh, Leon, you are so good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's do that.	It's a real Paris reunion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.	Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?	Get out of here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And if we have to go to Siberia...	I'll send you a muff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.	I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comrade Buljanoff...	Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...	Comrade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.	Too bad we have to waste all that time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bad news?	Look for yourselves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, monsieur?	Just looking around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Comrade Kopalski.	Monsieur.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.	Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Allow me, Comrade.	No, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you, you three scoundrels?	Well, we're back home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was that talkative?	No, that was restful. Again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not funny, huh?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do?	And General Savitzky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comrades! Comrades!	Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!	Shhh! Shhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.	No. Nobody will find us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would that make you any happier?	Much happier.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No music.	No, no music.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Leon!	Good morning, Swana.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Leon darling!	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, please...	What do you want?
May I have your bags, madame?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... that's my business, madame.	That's no business... that's a social injustice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...	Then tell Richardson to fire him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.	Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't touch Hoover --	I thought the gloves were off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry ...	... go on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I say something, Mr. President?	There's no secrets here, Al.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	Cox!  Fire him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The army?	Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.	How do you see this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, why not?	Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... he'd just found out about Track 2.	You never told him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I promised Iran to Townsend.	Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More light, chief?	No ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Richard ... come with me, would you ...	Why me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.	Is it my turn?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't ...	Thou must.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.	What ... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom expects great things from you ...	Harold ... can I get you anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you for coming, Dick.	Winning?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my goodness ...	How about you?  Are you going to win?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.	Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?	Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.	That was Mr. Kennedy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.	Looks can be deceiving ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
But it was all we had.	... but it was all we had.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.	Mr. Nixon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hello ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got the press this time!	"And we got the ""big mo""!  We're back!"
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's in there?	POWs.  And their families.
So I'm supposed to be ...	Compassionate.  Grateful.
Proud?	Sir?
Of them.	Yes, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We lost ...	I know ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do it.  No more.	Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.	Is that the truth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you planning to tell me?	We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.	Do you really want this, Dick?
This.  Above all.	And then you'll be happy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you?	You can't expect me to explain that to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.	No ID in her room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I don't know what I do feel like.	"Try ""old"" on for size."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?	I don't know. My mind wanders.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carla Jean...	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.	Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You ride Winston.	You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.	What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.	Mm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We goin' in?	Gun out and up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about yours?	I'm hidin' behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.	Believe you're right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably must be.	So when was he here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Now that's aggravating.	Sheriff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sheriff, that's aggravating.	I'm ahead of you there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was the bullet?	Wasn't no bullet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I love you more'n more, ever day.	That's very nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Be careful.	I always am.
Don't get hurt.	I never do.
Don't hurt no one.	Well. If you say so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe I'll go ridin.	Okay.
What do you think.	I can't plan your day.
I mean, would you care to join me.	Lord no. I'm not retired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got it Mama.	I didn't see my Prednizone.
I put it in, Mama.	Well I didn't see it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's in the satchel?	It's full a money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Where'd you get the pistol?	At the gettin' place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you buy that gun?	No. I found it.
Llewelyn!	What? Quit hollerin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Llewelyn.	Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?	Goin' out.
Goin' where?	Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Odessa.	Why would we go to Odessa?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.	Well -- how come?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.	Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why all the way to Del Rio?	I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.	You expect him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this about?	Step out of the car please, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm-hm.	Screwgie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Where's the transponder?	In the truck.  I'll get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You getting anything on this?	Not a bleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you find it?	No me mate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.	You from around here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is this.	You know who it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.	He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?	Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.	Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?	I seen you was from Dallas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Will there be somethin' else?	I don't know. Will there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.	I could come back then.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.	You said that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... I need to close now --	You live in that house behind the store?
Yes I do.	You've lived here all your life?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One room, one night.	That's twenty-six dollars.
You on all night?	Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.	What room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm wondering...	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You tell me the option.	The what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's me.	I got beers in my room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.	I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would he go to Odessa?	To kill your wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You didn't take the product, did you?	What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.	No I don't have it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?	Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
...I meant your food.	Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	You think a woman did that?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.	That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.	She said she was in Arizona, did she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right.	You sure? Maybe next week we could...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?	I take it I should. I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?	You're late, Eric.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.	Didn't I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...like the water purifiers?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!	Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!	Ahh, look, right now's not very...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter here?	I begged him to let me put that on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up, Merle... Williams.	Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She called you 'George,' George.	...did I win some contest?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't sound like you're from here.	I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?	I came for love. My fiancé is here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's something I had to do. For David.	'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got this apartment with a guy.	The one you were telling me about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess who I saw today.	Who?
Doctor David Ravell.	What? Where was he?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you say? Can we be friends?	...okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looking for someone?	You never know who you'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you with him this whole time?	Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...this is your sweater, right?	Where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.	Oh, yes, with the coffee...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.	...and put them in your mouth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bourbon, little water, thank you.	Beer, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Relax, we brought the cash.	I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!	You told me how to do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can live with that.	I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.	Should I kill him now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...	...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a really shitty thing to do.	I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd they describe her?	You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's this?	A doctor on the show... why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were right. Del wasn't lying.	Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Betty at twelve.	Very graceful. Perfect form.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seems like a nice place.	It is, if you like idiots...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	You better believe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ!	He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.	"""Injuns?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!	No! Let me try this!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lie, motherfucker...	I swear to God!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It ain't the law!	The law. Well the law is a human institution.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>

What do we do now, Everett?	Fire! I hate fire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.	Gopher, Everett?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.	What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whuhh...	Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm not sure that's Pete.	Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!	Oh my God!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...	Everett, my beard itches.
<EOC>	<EOC>

You're fuckin' A we can do this.	Not with me.  Not with people.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You're welcome.	Peace out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if she called the cops?	She didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He said open it.	Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.

<EOC>	<EOC>

Push that button for me, will you?	Don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch your mouth.	It's okay, Raoul.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, please.	Give me a break.

Small space?	Don't though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did the chicken cross the road?	What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?	I don't know, why?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Alma I told you to...	Fuck that, we've got company...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... is it loaded?	"I tell you ""officer"", it wasn't..."
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got to sit on Eldridge...	Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck?	Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So... we understand each other Judge?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of the car.	What's with you?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up with you?	Nothing.
"You got something on your mind... ""brother."""	"Yeah, ""brother"" My best friend is stone dead."
<EOC>	<EOC>
You alright?	Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll all get out of here together.	Later for that. I'm done either way...

My Mom's at that.	Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	Late summer.
Congratulations.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.	Pride will do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean, old and ugly?	You got me beat on both accounts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know him very well, do you?	He's my father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got salt last week.	Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're from good stock on their mother's side.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look well, Charlotte.	As do you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.	Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.	Do you?
Of course, I do.	Very well, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Charlotte.	Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.	Lovely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're surrendering.	Yes, sir.
What unit?	First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We did.	With a lace table cloth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.	Sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen any Redcoats?	Not yet.  What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.	You're in no condition to ride.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father...	It's already over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did your father teach you humility?	He tried.  It didn't take.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.	Yes...  ... father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These four wagons must be his.	And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go in there.	Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.	It's Mister Marion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A long time ago...	Thirteen years...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Francis.	Goodbye, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your son, what did you name him?	Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How far away?	Four, five miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reverend.	I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gray.	Earned.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.	Remember Braddock?
That bad?	Worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet, Thomas.	When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put those away.	But father, they might come this way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.	Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father?	Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, you can't let them take him...	Quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?	You'll see soon enough, hon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.	Is that right, dad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gorgeous!	Am I really gonna have my own room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, but the rope might be--	Yaay!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paxcow says it's almost too late!	Ellie...Ellie...what...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please hurry.	I will. Come and kiss me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Yaay!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No-I guess not.	Yayyy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?	Well, I thought it was safe--
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?	For a little while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good God! Where'd you hear that?	Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he really all right?	Yes.
Because you promised.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up, sugar?	Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.	Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you swear?	I swear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You need a glass?	Not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You folks ready to go on?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet...how much further is it?	Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bagged cat. What a mess.	You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Going to tell Ellie?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.	Is there quicksand?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Almost there, Louis.	You keep saying that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are those for?	Your cairn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doesn't look like they last long.	Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?	Because it's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I have another one?	I guess it wouldn't hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rachel not feeling well?	Well...a touch of the flu...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.	This babe has said enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.	Shit! Look at this mess!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let her go. It's cool.	Louis, the house is beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Buckaroo Banzai.	Come on--let's parole 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gage's gone!	Jesus, the road!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you. Thank you so much.	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The movers--	Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God!	It's beautiful!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think it's rather extraordinary.	Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's enough of that kind of talk!	I just said--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, honey...you know that...	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Getting there.	I got eggs down here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to try to do better.	You're doing fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!	Aye, aye, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's in your head, boy?	She.  Goes.  Free.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.	You can't.  I can.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how did you get off that island, anyway?	You can go to your grave not knowing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I really think I do.	All right then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?	Men!  Are you up for it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's ... another exit?	Aye, for us there is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now?	Now.  No, don't kill him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maid or not, it fits you.	Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you not know what this is, then?	It's a pirate medallion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man overboard!	Boy overboard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?	Yes -- yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --	About the day we met. Do you remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm glad we got here in time.	Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Swann.	Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You?!	Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!	No, I'm -- rescuing you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To freedom.	To the Black Pearl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?	That he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd best drop canvas, sir!	She can hold a bit longer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blast it, I'm already awake!	I know.  That was for the smell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?	I don't think that will be necessary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This dock is off-limits to civilians.	Sorry, I didn't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Smith.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?	Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.	Indeed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cheated.	Pirate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can get you out of here.	How?  The key's run off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agreed.	Agreed!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not without my effects.	We need to go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is either crazy, or brilliant.	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!	Aye!  Avast!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tortuga?	Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	I'll lead them away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any idea where you're going?	Jack!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you certain this is the right way?	It's the right way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?	And no lies!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's still breathing.	Where did he come from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Commodore --	A moment.
But --	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long do you leave him in there?	Until he's done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wheelchair accessible.	Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?	No, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do to him?	Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How apropos.	Ain't it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know what you're doing.	You mean besides kicking your ass?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like rotting meat.	You're not rotting meat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Icky!  What's happening?	Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?	No, Icky, this is real.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It will be an ascension.	I'm so excited, Icarus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?	Considering what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poppy, please --	If you loved me like I loved you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did he go?	The trunk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.	Thank you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were never invited to my house.	You're looking for a urine sample.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe this is happening...	Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	It's Sim.  We're almost there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, please try to hold still.	So, I guess it worked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Susan!	Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you...?	Been out for six months now.
Really?  What have you been doing?	You know, this and that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing really worthwhile.	That's what I thought.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daniel, give him the Trix.	Susan, this is the future of America here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They did it to me!	The nanobot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... just like the mouse.	Mouse?  What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.	What happened to it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't have time for hysterics.	We don't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is something wrong?	No, no, I just feel wired!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Susan!	What?  What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at this!	What about it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just like old times.	Yeah.  Old times.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.	Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	The nanobot... it's not here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How far can you stretch?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's pretty good.	Getting used to it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you go?	On the counter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is he?	The head shrinker at the prison.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!	I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You saved my life.	Did you think I could just leave you...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going after Argon!	I have to!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Things do change.	I guess they do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All the different ways that I could kill you.	Oh yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's impossible.	It's a miracle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vermin...	Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could have you fired right now.	You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Icky!	Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.	Don't worry, four eyes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What in the hell?	Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indeed? How interesting.	Yes - isn't it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I better go, Stew.	I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't mind Mother.	I don't mind her if you don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I use your telephone?	Certainly. Right over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose you're going to print them?	No - give you another guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.	So, it's obvious, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you step into the library?	Sure, I'll take a chance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?	For what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?	Of course I am Stewart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?	Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?	I poisoned him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.	Good morning. What does this mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's an excellent idea.	Oh, hello Mother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this person doing here?	Why
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah-ah-ah!	Mother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine. Have a seat.	Thanks, I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This way.	Oh, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine newspaper the Tribune.	Well, I should say!
I knew your managing editor very well.	Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, you see how silly that rumor is?	Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you very much.	All right, all right, don't mention it.
Give my regards to your managing editor.	I certainly will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Impossible. Put it on again.	Hey, make up your mind, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?	No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, I quit!	Yeah?
Yeah.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, when are you quitting?	Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
You're my what?	Your valet, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, outside!	I beg your pardon, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, thanks.	I hope you'll be very happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.	Hello, Stew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?	Been where?
To Old Madrid.	Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?	Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A statement? Good.	I have it here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	And now for that twentieth crack
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come in, Joe. It's all right.	Hello, Joe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some bicarbonate - quick!	Double strength!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Double-strength!	"""Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smythe, you've been drinking.	I have. Double-strength!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.	With pleasure, Madame!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop calling me Mother!	All right, Grandma
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.	I understand, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I	Now the lady said you may go
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done, sir. Very neat.	That's what I think of it, Bingy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shhh! Do you hear something?	Yes, sir.
You try it.	Me, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.	Very good, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Sue?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I ask you a question?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.	... Sex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you want to know this?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes ...  It's just that ...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.	We're in Pleasantville?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no ... I'm fine.	How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you got any make up?	In my handbag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it look okay?	Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?	No ... They won't be able to tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm so proud of you, Bud.	Thanks ... I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, hello Betty.	Hello Bill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, hi ...	I'm sorry ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just thought ... It's beautiful.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Having kind of a tough time.	I think it looks nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get this?	Bud brought it to me.
Bud?	Here's my favorite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?	She's crying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	She's crying.
No she's not.	Yes she is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait ...	I've got to go ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's alright. Let me see.	No ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't go out there.	But I really should get home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.	Yeah. It does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like a drum.	Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It goes away ... It'll go away.	I don't want it to go away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?	Um ... It's ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Why?	I think ... I might be ill ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.	It is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Sue--C'mon ...	What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...	So.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.  I can't.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm busy.	With what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't! Just let go.	It's better, Mary Sue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want some bridge mix?	Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...	I'm fine--but thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?  What is it?	Rain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you do this?	Yes I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know that it's illegal?	Yes I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I've got something to say.	Very well ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's like the basketball team.	The basketball team?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you know about the fire?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And where's that?	Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's outside of Pleasantville?	Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello Bud.	Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.	Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Simpson ...	Yes.
What color is that hedge of yours?	Green.
No, not that hedge. The other one.	The other one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme see that.	No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, David. Just give it to me!	Get lost!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Noooooo!	You--you gotta get us out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God.	What's going to happen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe this.	Neither do I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.	Just take deep breaths.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I still don't see why we're doing this.	We're supposed to be in school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
"Does he--you know--like ""me""?"	As a matter of fact he does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those are my friends.	Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Can we do any better?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jen, listen ...	I like--really need a cigarette, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do to him?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me too. Sounds swell.	Really? It seems so fattening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had nothing to do with that fire.	It's okay.
Not directly anyhow ...	It's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're reading?	Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?	... Yeah.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.	That's great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was sure swell ...	Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.	Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.	No. You baked them for Whitey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keeps going ...	Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Oh ... Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure ... Where would we go?	... Lover's Lane?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.	Oh ... Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmmgh.	Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.	You don't know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's it like?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want some berries?	Hunh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Rain.
Real rain?	Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do?	We'll just put up the top.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?	It was a prop for the school play ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I open it?	Sure ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they?	I'm not sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --	Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?	No.
You look nervous.	I'm not, I'm very happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah I can't.	OH MY GOD. Look at that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's all this pudding?	It's not mine.
Why's it here?	I have no idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye.	Call me later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you think you can?	No. I'm sorry.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?	....what....?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?	No.

What did he want?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a better place for us to eat.	Did something happen; are you alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was good.	Yeah.
I'll see you later.	Ok.
I don't freak out very often.	What do you mean?
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?	...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.	Ok.

Why?	Just have you for one second, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we agree that that is that?	That's that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....	I think you have a call?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry about that.	I didn't know you had a sister?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many sisters do you have?	....I have seven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doin' Barry?	Hi Walter.
How's business?	Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	That was weird. I meant good.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?	...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Barry....	Hi, Lance.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hi.
I need to talk to you for a second.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....	How much money do you have in your pockets?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.	What do you have in the house?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....	You have an ATM?
Yes.	Is this where you live?
Yes.	You have another house somewhere or something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So they'll go.	I'm only paying two of you guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?	Ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.	I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madeleine --	Yes, Abbe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
In part, yes.	He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.	I've you to look after me, haven't I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't turn us out, Abbe.	"""Turn you out?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go back to your room. Quickly.	What? What've I done?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --	You'll hate me now, won't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Free his mouth.	Mustn't do that, sir.
I must grant him his last rites.	I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?	It's not even noon --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean to take us all down with you?	Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He can't do that to me.	How can one man possibly be so selfish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?	His rug.
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?	Because your writing continues, unchecked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's no secret that you loved her.	Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --	-- that was lust --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Abbe de Coulmier!	I'm here.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was fiction, of course.	Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.	No. It most certainly was not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.	You'd suffer in her stead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.	Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.	Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm hungry for a proper visit.	Don't start --
<EOC>	<EOC>
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.	What's that then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surely you've seen a man naked.	It's only been described to me. In your books.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am eternally in your debt.	And I in yours.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?	....shame on you, truly...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave at once --	But it's just begun --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ever met Walter Winchell?	No, when I was but a tender lad--
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you ever gonna do a picture?	Not you too
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.	I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.	Am I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Louis	Randolph!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!	There's no call for that language-
<EOC>	<EOC>
How bad is it?	Nothing for you to worry about, darling
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're 125 million dollars in debt?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?	One . . . buys things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.	You will not walk out on me
You are repellant when you drink.	Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you for your time	Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep filming.	I can't remember the lines!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hearst?	Uh-huh
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are movies about, Orson?	Forget it-
What are movies about?	Telling stories.
Nope.	Showing life
<EOC>	<EOC>
Manolete?!	Who the hell's Manolete?
The great Spanish bullfighter	I don't wanna write about no spic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!	Orson, please ... it's too bright
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's 350 pages long.	Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you back	Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I'm sorry.	I don't care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I ever tell you about my father?	I don't give a shit about-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that from one of the Gospels?	Kinda.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit	George...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.	Yeah, ain't it swell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You talked to New York?	Yes
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."	Again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."	Again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."	Again
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."""	Again
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud"	Again
<EOC>	<EOC>
For the title	Ah, it's a grand title.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?	The ad..
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you better sit down	I don't want to sit
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.	Happy birthday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Orson, you wanna take five?	Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
<EOC>	<EOC>
How 'bout a real drink?	We done?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up, Colonel?	I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harder.  Take the towel off.	Jack! Enough!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you see her yet?	Give me a chance. Let me look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stick out your hands, Jake.	C'mon, Joey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Screw you, Jack.	Where you been?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that?	I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't find my ball.	Can you see it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you see it?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.	That's all right. He don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jake...	It's OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take off my pants.	Jake...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like the gym smell.	Now take your panties off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, touch me...  ...here.	Oh, Jake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I went out.	What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.	Are you drunk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The kids are sleeping.	I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Tommy. How are you?	Jake, sit down for a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the weight? Ok?	Yeah, the weight's Ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By the way  what happened to your leg?	I was jaywalking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel a little foolish?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who said they left then?	Who left -- where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever own a saw?	Well, in the garage, back home, we --
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I'm not a killer!	Your logic is backward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jefferies.	Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?	For getting rid of that cast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Did you get my note?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you get me that ring back?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.	Well, I only quote from the best.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I predicted it.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about this morning? Any developments?	No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A Federal offense.	Get back there! He'll see you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?	And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank heaven that's over!	I have a feeling we've just begun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you two talking about?	Got a shovel?
No.	There's probably one in the basement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you need money for?	To bail Lisa out of jail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One hundred and twenty-seven.	How much do you think you'll need?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten here.	Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.	Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.	You haven't even heard from him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your leg?	Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?	Empty as a football.
And you love life?	Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something big going on somewhere?	Going on right here. It's a big night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Big enough?	Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?	Of course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?	Without any future?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Something too frightful to utter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No comment.	Don't you see how silly you're being?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.	To get on home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something on your mind, Lisa?	It doesn't make sense to me.
What doesn't?	Women aren't that unpredictable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have all -- what?	Night. I'm going to stay with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate funny exit lines.	Who was the trunk addressed to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.	No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll rephrase the question.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wasn't that close?	Too close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What for?	Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steady Marlon!	Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	A new disease.
Friend of yours?	I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.	I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buzzie--we better get out of here.	What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel okay?	Give me some dirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	Good luck, Buzz.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know something?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, he's real abstract and different.	I'm cute, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meaning me?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Machismo?	Somebody find him a knife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where can we meet?	Know the Millertown bluff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just him.	Stay there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you say your name was?	Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.  It's fine.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother--	You make any sandwiches?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you let him tell it!	She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think so--	Well--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Except yourself!	Will you wait a minute?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.	I don't want to learn that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse us a minute?	Sure.  Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.	Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.	Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure?	I think I know my son.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See?  It stopped.	I still think you should go down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's there?  Anyone there?	Open it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he there?	No, honey.  No, he's not here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank!	Stay here.  That was my son!
<EOC>	<EOC>
John Crawford?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!	Well maybe she better start.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi there.
You remember me?	No.  I don't think so--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name!	Jim.  What's yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm here.	They're still there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you really going to meet them?	Who knows.  Plato?
What?	What's a chickie-run?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you get here?	I hitched.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.	My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey where'd you go?	I'm here.  Shut up.
Come out come out wherever you are!	Shut up.  Are you nuts?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's see how long we can stay under.	Man, you're schizoid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't he schizoid?	Hey!  How 'bout that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?	Not lately.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want you for my father!	Your father!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!	Get away from me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's swell.  How are you?	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I keep it?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?	My gun?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.	I need it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	Just a guard.
I shot at one of them.	But you didn't hurt anybody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	All right, darling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Bye, Mom.	Goodbye, dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!	Just tell a little white lie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.	Grandma?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Things pretty tough for you at home?	She eats him alive and he takes it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.	Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.	Yes, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Assault with a deadly weapon.	Listen--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Dawson High School?	You going there?
Yeah--why--	Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?	University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The kids take me.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.	A what?
Goodbye!  See you!	I'm not so bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You still pretty upset?	I'm numb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you do that?	I felt like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can trust me, Judy.	I feel as if I'm walking under water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.	See, we're very modern.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't talk underwater!	I bet you hear everything I say!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ever been in a place like this before?	Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	We have to go back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Plato!	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Judy--we're ready for you now.	He hates me.
What?	He hates me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's being called for.	You said you'd call my father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't you forget something?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was talking to Dad.	I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this him!?	Don't hurt him...
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?	Please, Gabriel, don't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??	YES!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wants the money.	No, baby. He wants me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"He wants... your ""sister""..."	...whoever she is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gotta be ten degrees out there.	Radio said negative five.
Negative five?	Yeah.
I don't think it's negative five.	Radio said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do that again.	What.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You need a COAT!	Ash, you've gotten me enough --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You forget where I work?	Beauty and fragrances.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...	Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...	Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?	They all are. Football's on.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You... you... YOU --	We still gonna spend Christmas together?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merry Christmas, Rudy.	I'm glad it was me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Rudy. How'd you know my name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not Nick Mason...	I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...	Yes!
So you could get with my sister.	Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be more specific.	A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?	Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.	No. It's her brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>

He knows his alphabet.	That's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we leaving?	It's too light yet.

Drop yours. I'm gunshy.	Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found their surrey --	So did I. They were in it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.	Hello, Miss Wells.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I -- lost something.	It wouldn't happen to be this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.	Which ranch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does she draw?	A little hot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's Lednov?	A man I used to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was he in jail for?	You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
In a fight?	The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.

Where'd they go?	Swimming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?	Just the grub box and bed rolls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't stop to think, Clay.	You better start.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what she asked me?	I don't care what she asked you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that the only reason you came back?	Sure. What other reason would there be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not bein' quite fair.	What's there to be fair about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not bein' quite fair.	What's there to be fair about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She mustn't -- don't you let her --	There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Just a thing I was workin' on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.	You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suppose I take a look.	Go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.	They went on like I told you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye and thanks.	I don't like to see you go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tried my best, but these things take time.	And we're running out of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not giving up?	How many ways can a man say no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on. Have another try at him.	What's the use.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.	Maybe you are. I'm not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know who we are?	Everybody knows --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clay Phillips.	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How far up the trail?	I don't know -- I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got to get movin'.	What for?
Because there's a man I want to see.	He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got company. Female company.	Yeah, we sure have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, yes. They're all I need...	Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doin' --	Lookin' around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?	Since I can remember, Ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're so nice.	Did someone say I wasn't nice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Miss Wells.	Good night, Steve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't we stayin'?	No. We're not stayin' --
<EOC>	<EOC>
And that's tough, isn't it?	Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was only teasin'.	Oh, sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.	Thanks, Steve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know what it is to be sorry.	Steve --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight.	Goodnight, Miss Wells.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I won't let you do it.	Alex, what are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Brenda.	Do I know you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My favorite memory was when we --	Would you die already?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch!!	Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's coming!	What?! What is it, a monster?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.	Hey, I have an idea...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cindy, what's going on?	It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello Brenda.	Hello Ray.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.	Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's right. I should go first.	He's so brave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ray, run faster.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you left your book back there.	Thanks. I'm Cindy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.	Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Buddy.	Open chest!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dude, somebody's on the rag.	Shhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should act out our inner most fantasies.	Great!!!
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about you, Buddy?	Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's here.	Shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel that?	No. Keep rubbing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cindy, let me...	No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, wanna' share a soda?	Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What should we get?	I don't care. You pick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, I get the point.	So, whatever happened to her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let her go, Cin.	But he'll kill her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about these buns?	Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?	Yeah, I broke my fall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Cindy.	I'm Hanson the caretaker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ummm!! They smell delicious.	Thanks. I made them by hand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hanson, please.	Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop touching his brain!	Um, I'm not touching anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop! --	Made you say it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Noooo!!!	Yes!!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing?	Just wait, you'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we gonna do?	We have to destroy him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...	Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo! That jacket is tight.	Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!	Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aww, the little bird died.	Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a great idea, Shorty.	I told you it would taste just like chicken.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you do that?	Uh, uh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, y'all! What's going on?	Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?	Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm telling you, it was possessed.	Theo, did you see the animal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I take it you're not mad at me.	I wouldn't go that far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like this, this...	Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think she's starting to suspect something?	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I finished all the interviews.	Let me see the files.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me help you.	I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you go, Professor.	Are these all the subjects?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are those cameras all throughout the house?	Yes, I thought that it would be best.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor, I think you should see this.	What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello Dwight.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you working on?	Just a little experiment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?	Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's right. We should stick together.	Alright. Come on, you guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not wearing a belt.	Alright, go to the belt store...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean to tell me we're dead!	I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh... I'm Father McFeely	Father, come in, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to see the girl?	Soon. First, I must bless this house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.	Because she will lie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh shit, you gonna take that?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No thanks.	My holy water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, I think you should rest.	No, I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit down and join us, Cindy.	Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo son, check this out.	Dog, you look hot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, y'all. My bad.	Shorty, why don't you say grace?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I woke up naked, too.	Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?	"It says, ""Ray."""
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.	Get out?! What does it say?
"""Fucked me."""	Aww. Cool. Dude.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Here we go again.	He's really cute!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi!	Jeeezzz!

DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!	I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.	Always the dentist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?	Is there a killer loose?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carl's a jerk!	He certainly drives like a jerk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No comment!	"""Serial Mom""?  WOW!"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.	She sure can pick 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chip, honey?	Thanks, Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!	Let me see!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!	Looks good, Mom!
<EOC>	<EOC>
In here, Mom...	But, Chip...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get in, Mom! I have to open.	This is so silly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.	Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's gonna kill Scotty!	BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Hank.	MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chip, your ride is here.	Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.	Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!	Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...	What a mess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""P"" as in..."	...People who don't mind their own business.

Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!	Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!	Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.	Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
<EOC>	<EOC>
MOTHERFUCKER!!	COCKSUCKER!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you just say?	PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!	I didn't do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you do drink?	Socially... I'll have a beer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?	NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And who may I ask is Carl?	Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He killed people, Mom.	We all have bad nights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!	Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's him!	No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!	Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?	Watch the booth! I'll be back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs... Sutphin?	Right here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man, that one made me puke!	You forgot something...
Are we leaving?	Yes you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Murder, honey.	Now, here's a babe!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.	What's he know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.	Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.	That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like this.	Which room is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You scared?	Yes.
Let's get out of here.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's only a little way, Mr. August.	I'd like to get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't stand here all night.	You could go and open the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much does she want?	She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.	She can only use cash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't got that much in cash.	How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.	For the time being, I imagine that must do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?	Oh, as beautiful as ever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But tell me --	She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what this is, Frances?	I ought to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you find him?	I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let her know what?	That you love Mary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She'll have to know some time.	Not from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be all right?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.	I have something even better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And the other was Judd?	Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.	I'd like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.	Cloven hoof?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would they hurt her?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it about Jacqueline?	No. She's no longer under my care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid not.	That's too bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.	That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it fifteen minutes yet?	"No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes."
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.	We haven't even begun tea yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ann?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was quick.	False alarm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever been on television?	Television?
Yes.	No. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This food is excellent.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother, father, sister.	Sister older or younger?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Who's Elizabeth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you mind?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are these?	Videotapes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.	All of these are interviews?
Yes.	Can we look at one?
No.	Why not?

Yes.	Sometimes. Afterward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he going to see this?	Absolutely not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you have sex before you were married?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you do fantasize?	Yes.
About who?	I fantasized about you.
About me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're really never going to make love again?	I'm not planning on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to touch you.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Graham...	I'm okay. It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John?	Mmmmm...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. I just got busy.	That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddam right.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bastard...	He does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You son of a bitch!!	Not very often.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have thought about it, yes.	You bitch. I knew it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God damn you!!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate my sister.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He just asked me questions.	What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.	Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here it is.	What is it?
It's a sun dress.	It looks like a tablecloth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was just trying to --	Hold on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's my share of the dress?	Thirty-two dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Well. I can't stay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have my work number?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I get real busy between two and four.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye.	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish you'd get an answering machine.	There's a phone here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like me to take my pants off?	If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you like the way I look?	Yes.
Do you think I'm pretty?	Yes.
Prettier than Ann?	Different.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.	Is that what he tells you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got to get back to the office.	I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John?	In here!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.	Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?	You know what I mean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want me to stop calling?	Look, I'll call you, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Plenty of room for two people.	It'll just be me.
Student?	No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.	Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.	How about for five hundred?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me your keys.	My keys?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Answer him, goddammit!!	You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Millaney?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus!	Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.	Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.	Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kiss, kiss?	Uh, OK. Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another kiss?	C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything wrong?	No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?	OK. But late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But where are you going?	Down to the incinerator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want me to breathe deeply?	Just breathe normally.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Could I do that later?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But they only think they're happy.	That doesn't make sense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my poor baby.	Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.

Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.	Me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
BRAD!	Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our field.	What does he know about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.	Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?

Isn't she lovely?	Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...	We love you, Baby.

The fuck was that?	The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Christine.  Hey you.	You guys having fun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay, Miles?	I'm good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.	I know. I might need to be spanked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?	Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.	Not so bad yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm thinking about the duck breast.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to you guys?	Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Highliner, please.	That's on us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't open that now. It's warm.	Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old's she going to be?	Um... seventy... something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.	Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.	Now we're talking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you smell?	I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what you do with every one.	When do we get to drink it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, you could work in a wine store.	Yeah, that would be a good move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you chewing gum?	Want some?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Jack, hurry up!	Just a minute!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. Tight.	Pour us a couple.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's to my last week of freedom.	It's going to be great. Here's to us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you no shame?	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the trunk.	You have the keys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.	Well, she is cute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pull yourself together, man.	I'm fine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you?	Bathroom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Later.	Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, boy.	She's been leaving messages here too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should call her.	I will.  See ya!
Right now.	Okay! Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd Christine say?	Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, there you are.	Yep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is Stephanie?	Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me on my cell if you go out.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?	Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.	Can you give me some room here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice shot.	You're an asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't come over the top. Stay still.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fucker hit into us.	Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...	Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like them?	Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.	Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?	I don't have to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it look like to you?	Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.	Hold on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Jack. Jack.	Hrnrnrn?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yep. Quite a day.	Quite a week.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, let me drive.	I'm fine. You rest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck!	You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!	I'll pay for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You broke some.	Whatever. Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well. That about does it.	Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.	So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Love you, man.	Back at you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.	Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to join us?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.	See you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you drinking?	A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?	Try it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm having the salmon.	That's what I'm having.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bathroom over there?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maya.	Don't touch me. Just take me home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Victoria.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.	Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.	This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, what are you doing?	I told you I need a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you think?	Quaffable but far from transcendent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Jack?	He had to make a phone call.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you, Miles. You take care.	Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miles, when are you going to get married again?	I just got divorced. Phyllis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?	It tastes old.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It makes me feel better.	Does she ever answer back?
No.	She doesn't answer me either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's dust in it.	This one?
A hair.	This one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy.	Don't touch him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think it's contaminated.	You don't even know what that word means.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The same windows.	That's weird.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want you to die.	Who said I was going to die?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm scared.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi sweetie.	Hi baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was just taking a walk before dinner.	You love walks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it hurt?	I don't feel much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And tell Merrill to swing away.	What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Explain, act crazy?	Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.	You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.	Just make noises then.
Explain noises.	Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.	You want him coming in the house next time?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I cursed.	I heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was very dark.	Yes it was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was very dark.	Yes, it was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morgan, be careful.	I got him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think it's a possibility?	Yes.
How can you say that?	That wasn't the answer you wanted?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you feel comforted?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Ray Reddy's house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should we turn off the lights?	They already know we're here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is going to do nothing.	We have to go in the basement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was only a year and half old.	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We won't be able to get out of there.	I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merrill --	I'm looking!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merrill!	Got it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're distracting us?	From what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can feel air.	Me too.
It's getting stronger.	I'm close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's good enough for me.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't touch him.	Graham.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Graham.	Don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These are D's; I need double A's.	I have some upstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's still making the noises. It's broken.	It's old Morgan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting out now.	Don't do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morgan?	It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So the aliens can't read our minds.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.	That means they're unemployed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.	Where are we going to sleep?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Isabelle?	We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
French toast... and mashed potatoes.	Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop crying!	Don't yell at her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll read our minds!	You're scaring your sister.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did someone save me?	Yeah baby. I think someone did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the strangest thing Father.	Don't call me Father.
What's that?	Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said something was strange. What's strange?	The footprints.
What about them?	There are none.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is anything missing?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.	He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he okay?	Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that him?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it!	You'll lose the signal!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.	What book!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!	Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All I did was kiss a girl.	That's why they got you in jail?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we lost 'em.	There's nobody coming?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Emmett.	McKendrick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't know you were out.	Did it seem short to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget it.	Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we'll see you sometime.	Yeah... maybe. So long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Gotta go...	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we?	Someplace safe. How you feeling?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I almost didn't.	Where's Jake?
McKendrick's men got him.	Is he alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gotta go.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More than enough.	Have you thought at all about your plans?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Parkers seem like nice folks.	They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.	I guess I put a good scare into him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't make it easy on a fellow.	Didn't Paden tell you that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.	Yeah... that must have been it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.	It's one thing to know it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.	Ten A.M.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Offend anybody lately?	Not for five years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta be going.	Going to Turley, was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's Turley like?	It's a town...
They got a saloon there?	I expect.
Women?	I expect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doesn't look quite fair.	Which way do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.	Anybody got any ideas?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll see you around.	Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You might make a farmer yet.	I've got a job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?	We didn't get that far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your brother?	He'll be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This a friend of yours?	He is now.
Who is he?	Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
<EOC>	<EOC>
New record.	Let's get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?	Don't press your luck, Carter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The jury saw it differently.	So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.	I was afraid of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why him?	Shut up. You need help, don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got there just short of too late.	Lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, it's working out real good.	Where's Emmett now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Cobb.	Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see you're prospering without me.	It's been a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a place to stay?	I just got to town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing like that will happen between us.	Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I took out thirteen dollars.	This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.	It is that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy, boy. Just an idea.	Well, thanks, but forget it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it you want from me?	Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.	So we understand each other?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You work here?	I run the place. What can I get you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	That's the good stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are a gambler.	Give me some of the good stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the dog now?	He left me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it that I can't figure?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about you?	I don't want you to get hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.	No problem.  Do you want to come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- You can't go in there!	-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.	-- I can explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My two favorite girls.	Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Simone.	She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank Simone for the tickets.	It was a great show, Dad...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.	Just a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is she here?	I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.	I know what you mean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Dad.	Hello, sweetheart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Dad.	Hello, Lainey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One thing bothered me.	I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-night, Daddy.	Night, Lainey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?	I do okay.  How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.	I noticed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Lainey.	I love you too, daddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't she thank you?	She did... didn't she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?	It's fantastic -- it's too much.
"It's the car she drove in ""Eternity Forever""."	I know.  Thank her for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About you and mom?	Me and Simone.  What I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice boat, Taransky.	It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.	I don't have time for this, Sayer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.	Er,... good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You love her, don't you, Max?	Don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a hotel.	I don't understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like me to read?	Yes, I'd like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Simone, are you there?	I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's take it down a notch.	-- What you don't understand --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Simone.	Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...	... digitized.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?	Yes.  Yes, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow. They called you their son.	We can keep it in the bathroom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--My God.	--Do I know you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you leave me?	I didn't leave you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, Malcolm.	Goodnight, sweetheart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All your soldiers speak Latin?	No, just one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to see you again, right?	If it's okay with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where should I look then, Cole?	Look over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.	He your best buddy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hates me.	You hate him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"You said the ""s"" word."	Yeah. Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.	What about Mrs. Marschal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you write?	Words.
What kind of words?	Upset words.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't know you were funny.	I forgot myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What makes you think that?	Your eyes told me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...No.	Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When they get mad, it gets cold.	Them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I ask you then?	Yes.
What do you want more than anything?	I don't know.
I told you what I want.	I don't know, Cole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to.	When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Crowe?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something happened, didn't it?	Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?	Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?	No, we're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish I were somewhere else.	Where will you go, where no one has died?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go home, okay?	I definitely won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were great in the play, Cole.	Really?
And you know what else?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're right here.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you thinking, Momma?	Lots of things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd give anything to have been there.	I'm ready to communicate with you now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Communicate?	Tell you my secrets.

You know that accident up there?	Yeah.
Someone got hurt.	They did?
A lady. She died.	Oh my God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can see her?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Cole, you're scaring me.	They scare me too sometimes.
They?	Dead people.
Dead people?	Ghosts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see ghosts, Cole?	They want me to do things for them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you thinking, Momma?	...I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She wanted me to tell you--	Cole, please stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Cole?	They used to hang people here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like people looking at me like that.	Like what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know how else to look--	You're a stuttering Stanley!

<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want me to say I did it?	I was kinda hoping, yeah.

What's wrong?	Security's locking down the elevators.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?	Yes.
That's fantastic.	Why did you agree to come here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You killed her!	Not her.  It.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.	How quickly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?	He's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.	Where's Sartorius?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.	He'll let me in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there anybody else here?	Why, who did you see?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.	Who was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.	Oh, that's a relief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much sleep do you need?	How much sleep?
How long can you go without sleep?	That depends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	She drank liquid oxygen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.	I won't be making the trip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, God.  I'm awake.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need to see Snow.	I'll go with you.

Don't.	Why?
I don't know.  I can't be alone.	I'll be right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are they?	To calm your anxiety.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're taking a flight?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rheya...	I want you inside me right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not a very happy poem.	You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.	And tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where've you been?	I been thinking about how much I hate you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to us, exactly?	You don't know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I really feel like... I am...?	Yes.  Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong.	You don't love me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who have you been talking to?	Sartorius.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But we fought.	Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?	You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?	No.  I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're the coward.	Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to stay here?	Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.	He is.  But he was here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.	Rheya --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you taking?	A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does it want?	I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He won't do it.	Why do you say that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Snow, get up here, now.	I'm not Snow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claire!	Hello, Win.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never seen anyone killed before.	It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Straight ahead.	Hard to find doors in this place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You live in Manhattan?	Queens... You know Queens?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.	Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you nervous?	No, Ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you pick one out, please?	Beg pardon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put it on my account, please.	I got money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can touch me, I won't bite.	Not too sure about that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.	I came on at 8:00.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"It was nice having you ""watch over me""..."	Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Mike.	Sleep good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claire?	What do you want?
Open the door, will you?	I can't open it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	They called here after you left...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You told her?	Not exactly.
What do you want to do?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a memory.	Do you dance?
Do you?	Pretty bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They guys treatin' you all right?	Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It wouldn't work.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd miss my life...	... Don't explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long you going away for?	Long enough.
"""For""...?"	"""To""... Forget about you."
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claire!	Mike...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone's all right...?	Yeah.  It's all over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So.	So.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You still going away?	I don't know...
You don't have to, now.	I think it's probably still a good idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll miss you, Mike.	Listen, I'll... see you again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like your coat.	You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say goodbye, Mike.	You take care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... just saying you should think twice about it...	... I don't want to talk about it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep what handy?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?	Sure we are, let's go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?	I don't know Tommy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tommy...!	I'm all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.  The neighbors.	Let 'em eat their hearts out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?	Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellie...	I'm all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.	I heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
At my house...!	Call a cruiser!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not Koontz.	Be happy.  He's good at this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wasn't your fault.	It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me I'm dreamin'.	I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're here 'til what time?	I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold it...!	I'll prove it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch your step!	What the fuck you doin'?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're we having?	My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice threads Dad.	Yeah, I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?	We're gonna pass the street.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sexual tension...	Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, look who's dressing for success.	At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Flash isn't?	Be nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter-- you took this picture?	Let me see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you go, Pete.	Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?	No. No, that's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was there.	See?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lizzy!	I was sort of hoping to get out of--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!	Hm.  What a lump.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flash, get lost.	Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.	They'll never take me alive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's in there?	A little bunny I saved from dissection.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."""	I know.  I've got one too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get mugged or something?	Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now tell me you love me.	Lemme down, bugface!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	Get away from me, freak!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.	I think you're trying to tell me something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't focus...	Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Liz.	How very dull, Peter Parker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  I was lying about the coffee.	Thank God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.	Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing this weekend?	I've gotta study.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.	I'm sure you kept warm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit down and stop being such a child.	This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?	Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.	Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter?	I'm here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, Roz.	Any sign of our friend?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?	Precise equipment such as waldos
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's nothing in there worth stealing!	That's the understatement of the year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Friday night...	Yes.  Do you have a date?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The record--	It'll shut itself off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that?	Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A match made in heaven.	See?  You big dullard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  No thank you.  I have work.	I heard about Thorkel's order--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Parker.	Hi, Professor.  What's up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter, what can I do for you?	An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.	Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.	Really, Professor, I--
<EOC>	<EOC>
"This photo you took of ""Spider-Man"" -"	Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.	I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.	I'll try. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.	Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get the clown suit?	Like it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--	I just gave-- yeah, sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.	I'm not so happy myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?	Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up here, Docky Ocky!	No, no!  Not there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with him?	Plenty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We made a deal with Barrack One.	Any news on Dunbar?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.	Looks good outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on!	Static!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Roger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's only one pair left.	We'll get some more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have a cigar.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brother, were we all wet about you!	Forget it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put me down for ten, you louse.	I'll call the whole pot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.	Okay, Security -- what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then we're all in on it?	Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You killed them, huh? Both of them?	Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's blow, Chauncey.	Let's!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jawohl!	Some are not bad at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this? This is water?	It's a mouse trap.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up, Animal!	Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me go! Let me go!	They'll shoot you, Animal!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Animal.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy, Animal! Easy!	Where'd that come from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!	He's the grrrrreatest!
<EOC>	<EOC>
To the Brick Kremlin!	She'll never forgive me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do those broads say?	What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.	It's not good for you, Animal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.	You hold him. I'll slug him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?	Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Grable, not Gable!	Do Jimmy Durante!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do Grable.	Hey, here's Esther Williams.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll open mine now.	I'll open mine, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have this dance, Miss?	Why, sure!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Betty! Betty!	This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me do it, Hoffy.	You want to go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Schulz?	We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay out of it, Sefton.	Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody call?	Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?	We did it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could use a new one yourself.	Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.	Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.	Just what makes you so popular?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Give this to Joey, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ach so!	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?	Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?	Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll make it five hundred!	No! No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.	Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?	Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
<EOC>	<EOC>
From a chicken, bug-wit.	A chicken?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it all right if we smell it?	Just don't drool on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have a nice time over there?	Oh! Somebody was peeking!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're stuck with me, eh?	Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You heard him.	Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Toh-pak-cha=8A	HoS qorDu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.	We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's working.	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.	He is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Target their Bridge.	Full disruptors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is its current position.	Can you project its course?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"""	Commander.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I get it. I get it.	You get what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!	One minute to warp core breach.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.	The station complement was nineteen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're within range, sir.	Beam them directly to Sickbay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.	I'll go. You have the Bridge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?	You're in the Nexus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, may we have a look around?	Please, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.	Oh, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't have a tractor beam.	You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beautiful day, isn't it?	Yes, yes, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, it's not. It's better.	Better?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?	That's right.
Close to retirement?	I hadn't planned on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep her together until I get back.	I always do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir?	Make it so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a pretty big margin of error.	Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, are you all right?	Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or perhaps they're on the surface.	Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doctor Soran?	Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must think I'm quite the madman.	The thought had crossed my mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The royal...studs?	You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks like we're too late.	There are no other ships in the system.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.	Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.	Lock phasers and return fire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Transwarp at your command, Sir!	Execute!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?	Soon, Captain... Quite soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?	Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.	Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still no response, sir.	Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing on my scanner, sir.	Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.	Scotty...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye sir, coding now.	Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.	Locate.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe it...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...	A photon tube...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Spock's burial robe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Later. Let's go...	Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This planet is aging in surges.	And Spock with it. They are joined together.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.	I'll go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...	Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Scott?	I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.	Sir...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.	Scan for vessels in pursuit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --	Aye, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many more?	Just him, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Genesis planet is gone.	Goodbye, David.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God...	Much is at stake...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, yes, Spock...	The ship... Out of danger...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?	She's to be decommissioned.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... We have cleared Spacedoors.	FULL IMPULSE POWER!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...	Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.	Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.	Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See! That shimmering area.	Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!	Fire, Mr. Scott!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...	What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --	Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.	It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.	Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gentlemen. Good evening.	Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome aboard, Admiral.	Welcome home, Jim.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Doctor McCoy?	Indisposed, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...	You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.	But, why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
So!  Speak!	Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I ordered no interruptions.	But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Range: 3000 Kellicams.	Steady. Continue on impulse power.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
1,000 Kellicams, closing!	Wait!... Wait...
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.	Put him on screen!  Study him well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Physician, heal thyself.	That's all you have to say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shore leave, Admiral.	Ah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?	The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?	Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now that's what I call a meal.	It's like the Garden of Eden...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Until now.	We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?	Young. I feel young, Doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David --	Mother, go back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jim --	Go back. I'm going to kill him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're crazy -- !	I saw it -- !
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!	What's the matter -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But the child --	Never mind! Hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Dr. Marcus --	I'm Doctor Marcus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you tell me?	She's making it up! My father was Professor --
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a long story.	We appear to have plenty of time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the Genesis Wave!	What?
He's on a build up to detonation!	How soon --
We encoded four minutes --	We'll beam aboard and stop it --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't mean to intrude.	Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.	Is that what you came here to say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let go -- he can't -- !	Only half of you would get there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you looking at?	The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.	Oh, I believe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are <u>you</u> looking at?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir -- our shields are dropping!	Raise them --
<EOC>	<EOC>
They won't --	<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
<EOC>	<EOC>
Departing dark side, Regula.	Visual --
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll lose them if they go in there.	Rake her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tactical!	Inoperative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yours... is... the superior...	I shall avenge you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time's up, Admiral...	Here it comes. Now, Spock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just barely, sir.	I'm going down to the station.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.	Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhura. Can't you augment?	I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not responding...	Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.	Picture, Mr. Saavik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Scott on discrete.	Scotty, let's have it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On screen.	Admiral --
<EOC>	<EOC>
... No response, sir.	Sensors, Captain?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!	He'll die -- !
<EOC>	<EOC>
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.	Admiral, this is Spock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meaning you can't even beam us back?	Not at present.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And who is this?	Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?	Yes, SIR.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is the word given?	The word is given: warp speed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.	To be sure, Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carol Marcus --	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's she doing here?	Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not enough against their shields.	Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The prefix code?	It's all we've got.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What IS working around here?	Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
That's it?	Best we could do in two hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.	Steady as you go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Admiral, they're reducing speed.	Uhura, patch me in --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock!	The ship -- out of danger?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... the good of the few...	Or the one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...	Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?	It is still regulation, Admiral.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Take the test again.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Reliant's command...	HURRY.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?	The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'	'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was close --	They just don't want us going in there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold your course. Look sharp...	At what.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Saavik, all stop.	All stop, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cease fire. Look sharp.	Power levels quite low, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Saavik, get us out, best speed!	Aye, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time from my mark...	Two minutes, ten seconds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time!	Three minutes, thirty seconds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...	Aye, sir --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop engines.	Stop engines.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...	Engage warp engines --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Sulu... The shields!	Trying, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't get power, sir!	Scotty!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.	Try again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Admiral on the bridge --	Battle stations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.	Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.	Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shields activated!	Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.	Aft thrusters, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are clear and free to navigate.	Course heading, Captain?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Prepare for warp speed.	Ready, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fire all phasers...!	No power to the weapons system, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.	Aye, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All moorings are clear, Captain.	Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.	Aye, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Certainly...	By the book...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lied.	I exaggerated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heard there was some excitement.	Just a couple of kooks...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?	A moment alone, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you say she was getting?	Cramps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
An experimental device, doctor.	Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wake up, man, wake up!	Come on, Pavel...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.	Not me, Bones... They did it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.	Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're saying... It is a compliment.	It is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell do you think you're doing?	Reading the patient's vital signs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Find it?	"Yes, under ""U.S. Government."" Now we need directions."
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?	Like what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shields, Mr. Chekov.	Shields, aye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No choice now, Scotty!	Sir, heat shields at maximum!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, well done, team 2.	And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.	Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you were at Berkeley.	I was not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you won't change your mind?	Is there something wrong with the one I have?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're gonna hafta take their chances.	What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, ma'am. No dipshit.	Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.	How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you trust me?	Implicitly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	What's what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?	A spaceship with a missing man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You tricked me.	You need me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God, we're too late!	Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?!	To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Spock, your computations?	In progress, Admiral.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Admiral. Full power is restored.	Thank you, Spock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?	They did, Admiral.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock: Condition report!	No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.	Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Warp two... three...	Steady as she goes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!	... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?	Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready sir.	Go, Mr. Sulu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.	Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!	Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
<EOC>	<EOC>
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.	Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have no control, sir!	Picture, Uhura!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.	Aye, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.	On speakers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any luck...?	Nothing... I should never have left him...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bearing!	Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Estimate range, ship to whales!	Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't, sir -- Nothing!	Out of control, and blind as a bat!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.	Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.	Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...	Mr. Sulu?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?	Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The whales...?!	No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override -- ?	It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!	Admiral, you'll be trapped!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor Scott, if you'll --	I demand to see the owners! I demand --
<EOC>	<EOC>
With pleasure.	Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --	I will. Can my assistant come, too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello? Computer...?	Just use the keyboard...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Transparent aluminum?	That's the ticket, laddie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother and son. You arranged this...?	I thought it might begin the healing process.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you ever get tired?	My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anij!	Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
No... I want to stay with you...	It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to go home now.	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can he breathe under water?	Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very funny...	Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...	They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will he live?	Yes. But look at this medscan...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's stabilizing.	Is it safe to move her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Data...	Captain, Geordi...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes... that looks like them.	What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'	From the mission...
<EOC>	<EOC>
A ship,	It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...	Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many?	Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll order Riker to turn around.	Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.	Do you have everything you need from command?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Implants bothering you?	It's nothing. I'm just tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...	Options?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think they believe us.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.	We're through running from these bastards.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're powering their forward weapons array.	Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'	Deck ten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	Commander Riker...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Deck five.	You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.	Aye, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must be planning on doing some hunting.	Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is Sojef, Captain.	Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?	No, we're here to... rescue them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.	Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worf to Picard...	Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain...	Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come out, come out wherever you are...	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...	Beam him out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scanners are off line!	Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!	Transferring controls to manual.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?	No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.	We have to find shelter...
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Population three hundred million...	Say the greeting again...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...	Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would we be involved with these people?	Good question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't done that in a long time...	What...?
What you're doing to my neck...	Was I doing something to your neck?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...	But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?	Or you could try lying down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Augh.	Augh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Initiate launch sequence.	Activating injector assembly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You actually performed surgery...?	It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long has he been unconscious?	At least four hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?	Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't it better like this...?	Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have helm control.	Where's the Sphere?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The vortex is collapsing, sir.	Contact Starfleet Command.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What year is it?	According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the battery room for the hospital?	I told you, there's no --
Where?	Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do to the batteries?	Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.	There should be an access hatch nearby...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...	I have the password right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready to make a little history?	Always am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain --	This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...	Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...	There's a red light on the second intake valve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.	As they used to say... all systems are go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ATR setting...	Active.
Main bus...	Ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where in the States?	Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You seem to have an answer for everything.	Something wrong with that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is no invasion...	Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take care of him. He's a very special man.	Yes, he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Money."" So you can get dome money..."	I can try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.	Aye, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Incoming transmission from the Borg.	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Life signs?	Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Track their weapons fire.	Western hemisphere... North American continent...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Port battery, ready sir!	Fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...	Steady as she goes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Target locked!	Fire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.	Onscreen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Report.	We're still in Earth orbit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like they damaged the silo...	Life signs?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck, sir.	I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Return to our own time?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?	Unless you'd like to stay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are they doing?	They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...	Computer -- thermal enhancement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...	They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to stop them from sending that message.	Agreed. Options?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!	Understood!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Report!	We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're bypassing Engineering...	Where the hell are they going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I remember it made me sick.	What are you suggesting?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worf to Bridge.	Riker here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worf? Is something wrong?	Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell happened down there, Worf?	Commander... we have a problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck, Captain.	I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I believe the operation is over.	The charge is murder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...	Vulcans sleep lying down...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock, that was actually funny.	We DO sleep lying down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...	Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or not to be -	That's the question -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, Jim...	You heard the order, Lieutenant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the Hell's going on?	I wish I knew. Uhura?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks...	What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Figures.	We've been set up all along.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.	We're not finished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it with you, anyway?	Still think we're finished?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...	No way.  You see this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damned clever if you ask me...	Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
<EOC>	<EOC>
ABSOLUTELY NOT!	Come on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is fun...	Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Too bad we can't SMELL her.	In space, no one can hear you sweat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you carrying a surgeon?	We were until your torpedoes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?	Barely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll respect him now...	That's a comfort...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.	I'm not sure how to take that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you care to go topside?	Very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's a DOCTOR!	How can I trust --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are those your words?	Yes.
Spoken by you?	Yes...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.	Those words WERE spoken by me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were demoted...	Yes.
For insubordination.	I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is Mr. Sulu?	Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??	Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just the size of my head -	I know what you mean...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Torpedo room--?	Uhura, monitor!
<EOC>	<EOC>
From Starfleet?	Who else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's here - somewhere.	But if she's cloaked...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shields. Battle stations.	Shields up. Battle stations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're preparing to fire.	Shields up, Captain --?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, sir.	Mr. Valtane, any more data?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.	Onscreen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
An INCIDENT?	Do we report this, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your friends are late...	They'll be here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't it about time you became something else?	I like it here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What took you so long?	Kill him! He's the one!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.	He's got it.
And your coat.	Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you know...?	There's a reward for your death.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't get many presidential assassins.	We didn't kill Gorkon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.	Except us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stand down your weapons.	Captain, if --
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.	Aye, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is incredible -	WHO ELSE...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aft thrusters -	Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, sir.	Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?	I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...	Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope you're happy.	Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, our shields -- !	Uhura, signal our surrender.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just the prototype.	You hear that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never been this close.	The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...	We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?	Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the -	We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
<EOC>	<EOC>
We HAVEN'T fired -	According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The peace conference.	What peace conference?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Close enough to beam down?	Not yet... Section 4236...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Control tower, reading, Sir.	Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Channel open, Captain.	This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain --	WE SURRENDER.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gorkon's own man??	Who else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must have faith.	Faith...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her own father...?	Such things have happened before, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A lie?	An error.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you are logical.	I don't want to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Direct hit -	Confirmed, Captain!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Praxis?	What's left of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
NO WAY!	Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuzzy face is gone.	Yes, please continue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know who I am?	You are me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know where you are?	I am in a room with lights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you remember our father?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beverly, come in.	You're working late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So... To happy endings.	To happy endings.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He is very observant.	I can see that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Data!	Sorry, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A bit less florid, Data.	Aye, sir... This way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A weapon.	It would appear so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you imagine this is?	Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are losing dorsal shields.	Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are being hailed.	Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.	Negative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
It appears to be...  ... an arm.	Why is it moving?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's you.	The resemblance is... striking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you wouldn't mind.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have this dance?	With pleasure, Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Counselor.	Do you have a moment, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to miss you.	And I you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can you be certain?	I know how he thinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But how can he? He'll kill you.	This isn't about me anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Imzadi. This is so good.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.	You sick bastard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	I can feel your desire, Deanna.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.	Do you have life support?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he doing?	He wants to look me in the eye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long until he can fire?	The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, we're being hailed.	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.	Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
To find the head, sir?	If you don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.	Not yet, Mister Worf.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're being hailed.	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, we're being hailed.	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Your new chair, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.	A coup d'etat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.	She's a predator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not very chatty.	Away team. Transporter room four.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Strength in numbers?	We can only hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Serving with you has been an honor.	The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you're not as we imagined you.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Praetor?	I've never met a human woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.	You'll acquire a taste for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
After you, Praetor.	Age before rank, Jean Luc.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So I'm not as tall as you expected?	I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.	There is that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In time, Jean Luc.	In time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Jean Luc.	Why am I here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.	I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.	On my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Report!	Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Target disruptors. Destroy them.	Disruptors are off-line, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that sounds relaxing too.	It is... invigorating.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So theyve got him up and running.	He's a very unusual android.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God...	Should I raise shields?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.	Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Intruder alert!	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we prepared?	Yes, Praetor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The bond is broken.	Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.	Do as I tell you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.	Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long?	A matter of hours now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long until we reach the Rift?	Seven minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Praetor...	FULL STOP AND FIRE !
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!	She is here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many Warbirds will you need?	None.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Benny, God, take it easy...	I don't want to scare them away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right in line with that burning tree.	I don't see anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did I tell you?	Probably kids.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you think you should call a backup?	No, we can handle this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?	I don't think so...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gate three. It's boarding now.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can I do for you folks?	How much are your rooms?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?	We should have. Let me see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have children?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think of America?	It is beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!!! No!!!	He's got a gun!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you stop last?	What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?	Stay right there...
What was your last stop?	Elmo's...
Where's that?	About five miles back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Contain it and get back to me.	What do you mean by 'contain?'
<EOC>	<EOC>
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.	Oh shit!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No deal.	I'm afraid we can't let you go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George... Do you hear me, George?	What?
I just retired.	Shermin!! Shermin!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won't let anyone hurt you.	Watch it. They're coming out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...	Don't... don't do this... please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...	Which way do you want to go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	What.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah... no...	Ah no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steering wheel...	What.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steering wheel.	Steering wheel.
Gear shift.	Gear shift.
Dashboard.	Dashboard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Eh... police.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way?	That way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Flashlight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Coupons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Pancakes.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?	We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Smile.
Smile... good?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Minneapolis... good.	You're full of tricks, aren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No gas.	No gas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go.	It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Closed?	You'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	I am...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a big help. Where are you from?	From?
Are you from up there? Space?	Space?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gas.	Closed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No gas.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	Shit?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.	Shit... shit... what shit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
In your pocket, please...	You. Mouth closed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Money.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Candy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is...  ...Coke?	A drink.
I...	You want to try it?
I want to try it.	This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Horses.	Horses.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Music.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I will see it next time.	You better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When do you have to be here?	I do not understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?	Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jennyhaydn.	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I was afraid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Are you my friend?
Yes.	I am your friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody knows.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like this music.	I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have music up there?	Yes.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?	I do not want to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am not a good singer.	That was beautiful.
You liked my singing?	Yes. Sing some more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you angry at me?	No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?	I feel better if I move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Asshole!!	Where did you learn that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not going to get a ride tonight.	I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.	You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.	You promised.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you saying?	You can stop. I will go on alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are cold.	You're damn right I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning.	Horses.
You don't forget anything, do you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?	Do they talk?!
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you're pretty...	I gave you a baby last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have twenty-five cents, please?	What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is yours...	If you want to keep it, you can.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long will it take you to get home?	Many, many days and nights...
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...	I must go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do now?	You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you.	I'm never going to see you again, am I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell the baby about me.	I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me!!	You could have killed us both!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...	Call the police!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure this is your car?	My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.	Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They after you?	What? No, of course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait. Could I have your autograph?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it for real?	Get Fox.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell him I'm not here.	I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get that, Lyman?	We're ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Jesus.	We better get it into the box. Come on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You married, Major?	Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't understand.	Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I made my choice, Lenny.	You're going down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?	Forget it's there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cut it out, Tran.	Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faith, call me, okay?	No, Lenny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I understand.  No, I'm not.	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's been cooked-off	Is he dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.	I intend to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just did.	Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
About what?	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's his name?	Fumitsu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck are you doing?	Coming with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we having a bad night?	Let's talk in the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?  Present from Faith?	No idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And gives it to you.	Wants to share.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.	So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
<EOC>	<EOC>
No more, Lenny.	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatup Lenny?	Jesus, Mace!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where we going?	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	This tie doesn't go with blue!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is bad.	The gas tank's going to go any second!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you out of your fucking mind?!	Fire's out, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those two guys were cops.	You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's totally cut off from the outer world.	How long does it last?  Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see Tran?	Uh unh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright.  We're going up.	And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the original.  There are no copies.	Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?	Then we'll be right where we are now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.	Yeah.  We did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.	See you downtown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.	Take the tape to the cops.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?	Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?	Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?	No, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?	Ten miles back on the Texas side.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have the body?	She's buried.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?	Winona.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	Hi. What's in the case?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God.	Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.	What's wrong with me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been looking for you.	Why me? What do you want from me!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was sitting here?	It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have the photo from the diner?	At the field office.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Deputy Director, get out, sir.	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I talked to him.	Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.	From the grave?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?	Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.	I don't believe this.
I'm hesitant to...	Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.	Where's my watch? It's gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes I do.	It explains a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?	Because you asked him to, stupid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are Agency regulations about this.	"""Intra-Agency fraternizing."""
It's a no-no.	I know.
I've been thinking about this.	Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.	What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.	Not about coming to see Daitz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?	Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Jaime? Where are you?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.	What's up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This feels like something out of a spy novel.	I guess I'm a little paranoid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.	I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I'm going to Amarillo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agent...	Kulok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unlock these cuffs.	Sit back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.	No weapon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you know Speck was a killer?	The little piggie speaks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he dead?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was it Zero?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
[Reality very risky.]	Whatever happened to MyDick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
[Lionheart, what happened?]	Something came up, Murman, my man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How far is Amarillo?	350 miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.	Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should call your Grandmother.	Shuddup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it, Mike.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you ladies doing this evening?	What do you drive?
I'm sorry?	What kind of car do you drive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, thank you...?	Nikki.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
I'm Mike.	Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?	Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.	I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.	Why? You're not a real man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're out of Glenlivet.	What else is going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	My pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?	"I haven't heard an official ""no"" yet."
You haven't told then, huh?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"I'm considering taking a job as a ""Goofy""."	Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me just check on my boy.	Don't worry. He's in good hands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Always...	No matter what... like splitting aces.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...	"I'm a ""Dorothy""."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God.	Did you get it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The poor thing. Six years?	...And she's with someone else.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you guys do?	I'm a comedian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On the table.	Sorry?
You have to lay it on the table.	Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	You want this in black chips.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, it's just that...	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I should be getting...	...It's really getting late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I give you a ride to your car...?	...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...Which one...?	...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...	...get the hell outta here already...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?	Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.	I can call back...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to hit the town tonight?	I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?	Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kinda money, huh?	Classy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll get a Dewars rocks...	Bud.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.	Well, let's hit that party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?	I'll be your winger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, man.	No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't been drinking, have you?	No. Just O.J.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to talk about it?	What's the point?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uuuuugh!	Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.	She wasn't your type anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You little bitch!	Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's kinda money, actually.	Make someone bleed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pause it.	Give me the money. I'll get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.	So, what? Eleven?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he do?	He's trying to be an actor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who threw this party, anyway?	Damned if I know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going for you two?	Not well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.	I can't believe you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.	You asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good for you, man. He's being smart.	She's really special, guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.	Hang on, Voltaire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	S'up Trent?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vegas, baby!	Vegas!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vegas.	Vegas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wake up, baby.	Whu?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's where we make our scene.	You think they're watching?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mikey's the big winner.	What an asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatever.	Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh... a Dorothy.	Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys are such assholes.	Aww... He got away?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time's this party tonight?	It starts at eight...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who? Rob?	Yeah. You met him once.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...the Copa, in New York...	...through the kitchen...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...	...It looked money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you guys doing?	It's on.
Which one?	Minnie Pearl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	What?
You looked right at her, baby.	She didn't notice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got the digits, baby.	What a surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, don't mess with me right now...	We're not messing with you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not just, like, fucking with me?	No, baby!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long do I wait to call?	A day.
Tomorrow?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, two days?	Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not like that...	Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.	Oh. He's got it under control...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bitch... You little bitch!	Chelios to Roenick...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because he's a bitch.	That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...against the computer.	They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!	Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a surprise...	...How novel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it's on, baby...	...It's on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes she did.	Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was pretty cold, dude.	What was cold about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Tomorrow, then a day.	...Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's on...	...it's on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's on.	...it's definitely on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is on.	...it is so on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The bear's got his claws back.	Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...	You don't have to wait three days...
...Okay, two...	...just be smart about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you?	I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.	Good.  He never doubted you.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Outside.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think we'll go for that last place?	Maybe, or you gotta know now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You take care of your family?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it necessary?	You understand him better than anyone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.	How did you find out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see you have your Luca Brasi.	I'll need him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barzini will move against you first.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?	Yes.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Ever seen anything like that before?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike!  The party starting!	Come here a minute, Fredo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are those girls?	That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.	Mike!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, I don't know...	Can you do it Mike?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	An accident.  No one was hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you give this letter to Michael.	Mama, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never seen anything like it.	I told you I had a lot of relatives.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never know when you're telling me the truth.	I told you you wouldn't like him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.	How do you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael, what are you doing?	Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.  Kay?	How is your father?
He'll be OK.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I LOVE YOU.	Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't...	Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?	OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Your sister wants to ask you something.	Let HER ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you?	Let me think about it, O.K.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mikey, you look beautiful!	Cut it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to New Jersey?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you renounce Satan.	I do renounce him.
And all his works?	I do renounce them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you wish to be baptized?	I do wish to be baptized.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do.	What are you doing in Mongi?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.	Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What?	Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uncanny!	I don't get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Tom.	Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.	Did you speak to my father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm intruding.	Can you mix a martini?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like jazz!	I love jazz.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --	I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?	Your parents met her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're breaking my ribs!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any brothers?	No, no brothers, no sisters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.	Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think you can steer this thing?	Sure.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.	What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.	Aye, aye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Dickie?
Who is it?	It's Freddie. Let me in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.	Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr Greenleaf.	Tom. How are you? You look well.
I'm well, thank you.	Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.	Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.	Where's Mr MacCarron?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Mr Greenleaf here?	Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never said that!	Bird. That's jazz.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really should go in, it's marvelous.	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dickie!	I'll go and see what's the matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hates being confronted.	I think you're right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello Peter, so good to see you.	Hello Marge!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at me what?	To the manner born.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very.	And you, sir? Any better?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did Dickie's Dad go?	He's having an early night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tom?	Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found Dickie's rings.	What?
You've got Dickie's rings.	I can explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.	Do you know Tom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you found Peter...	I think we sort of found each other.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this you?	No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your secret?	Excuse me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.	Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.	You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?	Where have you been since then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?	He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?	Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ditto.	Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he say?	He says so many fiancées.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not guilty.	I'll fix some drinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	I'm fine.
Do you want me to stick around?	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tom, are you okay?	You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?	I give up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dickie Greenleaf?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we go up? Do you mind?	Of course. What happened to your face?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a .44 Magnum?	That's an expensive gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?	He'll, what else can I do with it all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I'm leaving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is sort of high class...	I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...	My God!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the record?	Keep it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Travis.	Hello, Betsy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see where Palantine got the nomination.	Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.	Thank you, Travis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Travis?	Yeah.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Betsy, come over here a moment.	What is it? I'm busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,	Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?	Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
I have.	You carry a piece? You need one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
20 bucks?	Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Easy.
That ain't much of a name.	It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?	I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?	Iris.
That's a nice name.	That's what you think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you want to or not?	O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice talking to you, Travis.	Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you a Secret Service Man?	Why do you ask?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that so?	What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm no cop.	Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
I'm hip.	Funny, you don't look hip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sport. How are things?	O.K., cowboy.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?	What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.	Iris?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wha -- ?	Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Travis.	Hey Wizard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the action around?	Slow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Had a close one.	You want to talk about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not really.	You know how I feel about what you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spit it out.	MY girlfriend's pregnant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's me sir.	What is happening?  Where's Mason?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He says he's leaving the island sir.	Don't let him do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.	I'm a field agent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Motor oil?	For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Limp dick?	It's all I could think of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go.	Wrong.
What, vou?	I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Now they only have three rockets left.
<EOC>	<EOC>

What about you, Delly?	I am, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll stand by me?	Whatever happens.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you bring along something to read?	Damn...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?	Delly?  In here.
<EOC>	<EOC>

You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, did you remember that, or...	Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Delly, shhhhhh...	No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?	I... I need a drink of water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only one in town.  Get in, son.	Ben, when's Delly due back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here we are.	Well, son, you're home!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.	Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.

Wait'll you see the inside!	Can't wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've been closed for a while.	Ah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.	Mother.  She's beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They couldn't wait to see you.	Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.	Oh.  What... what time is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"""	Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ernie.	... Ernie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you two get out there and dance?	Oh, no, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Luke... what time is it?	Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	The film broke...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.	Then I'll call you a cab.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any idea how you got here, son?	No, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, one of mine.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Call me... Ishmael?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's where you live.	We live in a theater?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evening, Luke.	Evening, Doctor Lardner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You kids off to the dance?	Aren't you coming?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cigarette?	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit.  Play with me.	No, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there a young Tim?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's my r-r-rent.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, sit.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.	The customers?  I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tim, I have to tell you something.	Oh.
It's about me.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?	I thought you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose.  Thanks.	You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hungry, son?	Yes.  Very.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Hayworth?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you a friend of Mitch's?	No, not really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?	Yes, I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Daniels? Is that you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think I should go?	That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?	Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.	Then go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is anyone there?	Look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I did.	Just listen to them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother!	If your father were here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?	No!
Mom, they're in a cage!	They're birds!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They haven't harmed anyone.	Take them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Daniels?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is smoking fun?	Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?	I don't think your mother would like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!	Is she all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mitch, let's turn back.	Shhh. Shhhhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	The little Brenner girl.
Lois!	It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!	It's Alice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning.	Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.	Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.	Yep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know him?	Yep.
Where does he live?	Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?	Right across the bay there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much for the phone calls?	It's nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.	Birds are not bad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cut yourself outside, Miss?	Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gulls!	They're back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?	Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?	I'm simply quoting the law.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... well, is everyone all right?	I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...	I'm sorry, Mitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mitch...	Shhh. Shhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother, get a rope!	Oh, my God, look at her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can handle it.	I know you can.  But I'd like to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.	You're doing fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think Cathy's all right?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the last of it.	Did you close the door?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.	Shhhh. Shhhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a chimney swift, all right.	We know what it is, Al.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...	Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that for Mitch Brenner?	Yes.
He's not home.	That's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder if you could help me.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.	What made it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, but...	You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...	Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did he shoot her?	He was watching a ball game on television.
What?	His wife changed the channel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd still like to see you.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want some mustard with this?	No, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some cream?	I'll get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take Cathy up to bed.	Are you staying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think it's safe to get out now.	Don't let's take any chances.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they heading?	Inland.
Santa Rosa?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When will they stop?	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?	Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.	How about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The power.	Mitch...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd better light some of those lamps.	No... wait.  Hold me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There we are!	Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That... that... who was that?	I have no idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you got a pencil?	What? Oh, yes, certainly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?	Maybe! Is it impossible?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.	No one ever said you were, Mitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you plan to do that?	With smoke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.	...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I fear he may have to.	But can't you give me any idea?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have his promise, then?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.	Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --	Come in, boy -- come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. MacFarlane --	Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's unconscious.	Pulse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not a woman!	It was a woman when we put her in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you a doctor, too?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, but I still wonder how much.	I want it --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll not need that again, Georgina.	I wanted to see the white horse --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.	Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It might be an interesting case.	That's a good boy, Toddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Toddy hates me.	Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.	We have never been friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.	I've drunk enough tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can anyone hear what we say?	Only Brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crony indeed!	You can get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fettes -- where is Fettes?	I'll get him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going to Gray.	He must leave me alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've been with Gray again.	Aye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Check and mate.	Dream on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two down. Two to go.	"""Down?"" Wait, don't tell me."
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think I'm crazy.	I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it? This place?	I think we should get some support?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a fucking hollow point!	I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think maybe knives do?	Keep that thing away from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sssshhh. She's resting.	Where the fuck did you come from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lied at my trial.	I don't know you, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wrong. Answer.	Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fucking Zombie.	The scar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard you were looking for this.	You're the guy killed Dutton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck. Me.	What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The scar. Which of you has it?	Nobody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was a friend of your sister's.	I know her friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daisy. How did you know?	I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.	And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.	No! Why are you haunting me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where it happened. Right over here.	Yeah, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This tree. Here's where it happened.	I don't want to see!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's ok, it's ok...	It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?	I don't know. I found him lying there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... it connects you to me...	No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They botched the execution.	Could say that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fucking crow.	Sign of the dead come back to life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just don't believe everything you see.	Doubt is a motherfucker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything wrong?	Let's hope not. License and registration please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to walk a straight line?	I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?	What did I say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are there so many?	Just hold on to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Erin!	Watch out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I dropped an earring.	Looks like you have them both on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in with them.	It's not what you think.
You killed her!	No.
Stay away from me! Stay away!	Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They killed her because she found out.	About you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweetheart...	Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Such power exists?	I assure you such power exists.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Mom!	Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He gave these to you?	Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you an FBI man?	No -- I'm afraid not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think they'll ever find him?	I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?	Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.	Mr. Brady's a cop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.	We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello--	You ready?
I will be in just a minute.	The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.	I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know how to thank you.	I enjoyed every minute of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone seems so--	Jittery is the word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.	Goodnight, my dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- hello--	May I see you for a minute?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.	May I walk out with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	What time is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It must be twelve-thirty.	Yes -- Just exactly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure about that?	Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.	I'd give you a very good price.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like horror comics.	This one could save your life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you like Santa Carla?	It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.	You better get some fresh air.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All day.	Can't stand light?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	He's my brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.	Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!	We don't ride with vampires.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!	We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're gaining on us!	You gotta drive!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... we blew Plan A.	Time to activate Plan B.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All together?	Zero.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?	The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.	El Vampiro.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up!	We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're looking at us.	They're gonna book us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.	That's just the way we like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Death to all vampires!	Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!	The meanest!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We still going?	Honda 250, huh?
That's right.	C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We were gonna grab some food.	Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?	What?...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't!  Stop!	Why?  They're only noodles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm my own man.	Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going' on?	What's goin' on, Marko?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this, David?	You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going?	For a ride.
With him?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.	No.  Stick around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look.	You're almost one of us now, Michael.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't kill me, Star.	I will, David!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or a vampire.	Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not glowing.	Hit the lights again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that smell!?	Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Nanook!  Quiet!	Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go out there!  Stop him!	Sam, don't --
<EOC>	<EOC>
... And stay outta here.	You have a T.V.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, Grandpa...	Lots more where he came from.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we havin' fun or what?	I thought we were goin' into town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi... I'm Laddie.	This is Michael.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't tell David?	No.  Just you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like Michael.	I like Michael.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still mad at me?	For what.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He looks dead.	He's just a deep sleeper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!	Michael!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're getting close...	What's that smell?
Ocean air!	Smells like something died.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!	That's the boardwalk, Sam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell them to get something to eat.	I thought we were poor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me, Mom.  Help.	Soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lights out, Sam.	Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Michael?	He's already gone to bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.	C'mere, Nanook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no.  Now what?	Must be a circuit breaker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohmygod...	Mom!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say hello to Thorn.	Hi, Thorn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not impressed, are you?	Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This looks terrific, Lucy.	Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max!  What's wrong?	It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?	Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it burn?	Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you following me?	Well, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... yeah.  Sure.	Okay.  Talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi...	If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David's looking for me... I have to go.	You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to put this on.	Take laddie.
Huh?	Save Laddie first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?	They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gone.  I feel it!	So do I!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This room is mine.	I was here first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're beautiful.	Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?	What would that make Mom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you spill something?	No.  Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.	Wanna go to the comic book store?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom's home?...	No.  On the phone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm making you a sandwich.	Don't bother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael?	Don't turn on the light.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What??	Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Star.	Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you calling?	The Marines.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.	Huh?...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want from us?	Just listen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.	Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe dinner.	Dogs don't eat each other.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where these tracks headed?	Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, I know it's hard to believe...	So what's our problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... It could have gotten to somebody...	Anybody sick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?	Ain't it there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Don't walk behind me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.	Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody broke in.	Now who'd go and do...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got to burn 'em.	Now hold on, you dumb...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.	If it did get to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's open it.	Hell no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You catch anything he was saying?	Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said where?  Where'd you go?!	Was dark... find a light...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Torch it over there!	The dogs?
<EOC>	<EOC>
MacReady!	Look, I'm just guessing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the other half?	Probably the next meal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What we going to do?!	How the fuck do I know?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Torch them!!	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do about those three?	We got morphine, don't we.
<EOC>	<EOC>
MacReady!	What?
Garry's missing!	Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't tying me up.	Then I'll have to kill you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should have jumped his ass.	Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Load of bullshit.	We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think so.	"What do you mean ""you think so?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, what in hell happened here?	Come on, Copper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sweden!!!	They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything?	All in Norwegian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, who's got access to it?	I guess I'm the only one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would that test have worked?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now hold him.	I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And if anyone tries to wake me...	Damn you, MacReady!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess you're okay.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long will it take you to prepare this?	A couple of hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.	How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.	That far?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many in their party?	Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.  Why not?	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put that down!	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're on fire!	Don't let up, Childs!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?	I am going after them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks good.	One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long's it been?	Little over two hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four!	What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's...	Blair.  He's gone berserk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...	Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody definitely messed with it.	We going to make it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...	I ain't going with Sanchez.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of test?	I'm sure a lot of you already know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tie up Clark, too.	He's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were the flashlights?	Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Everything that's been missing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where was he trying to go?	Anyplace but here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Childs?	Forget about Childs.  He's over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get back!!	The generator!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it ain't coming.	Then we go after him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.	Who else could have used that key?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should sleep in shifts.	Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happened?!	MacReady, that you?
Yeah!	It's the generator I think!  No power.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hear that?	Hear what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It must have been hard, leaving your work.	The journey is part of my work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now how did you get hurt?	I had an accident.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you do on the towers?	On the towers?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah... no.	Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Well, you wanted to see it.	This is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.  Just about here.	But there's nothing here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because you'll never die.	Excuse me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God... I saw this.	It frightens you.
Yes...	It was meant to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, do we go on?	Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?	Oh, shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Machines?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vox?	This way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it all for?	The air... the power.
Why did they built it?	The Morlocks didn't build this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This has to end.	End...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now will you go?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a foolish thing to do.	I'm a foolish man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm tired of running.	Oh, you won't be running for long...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...	You know I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promised me flowers.	What?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?	Sorry... I was distracted.
Well there's something new.	I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.	Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, the moment is rather dying here.	Hold on... I know I have it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know it's not a diamond but --	A moonstone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...	You know I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex, what is it?	Holding you... again.
Darling.	I need... to talk to you.
All right...	Not here... alone.  Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's walk through the park...	No... let's walk through the city.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex, what is it?	Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God...	Alex, it's just the zoo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heavens, look at that now!	I've seen it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex... people are staring.	Let them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let them.	I have something for you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the future, we'll be better.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --	That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, David.	Good night, Alex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This... was my home.	His home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear me, lad?	All right, all right -- here -- everything --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're up!  You must be feeling better --	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His curiosity is amazing.	Mm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, that explains everything.	I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
That machine --	Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
How long ago?	More than 800,000 years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.	Thank you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, then.	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is magnificent...	Thank you.
"And this is your ""work""?"	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alexander...?	Orion's belt...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kalen...	Mara...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mara -- what -- ?!	Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh huzzah, the master's home.	Do you have it?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.	Here?
Yes, sir, he --	Tell him to go away --
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.	May I get you some --
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Eloi""?"	What are your people called?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.	New Yorkers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?	I suppose so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My fowl have polluted the yard.	Dean Fulton...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do at night?	What's it like where you come from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll see about that.	I am.  Are you a climber?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --	They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --	They're inside --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?	[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's recovering on the third floor.	Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Long live the Organization for the Organized!	Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Becker, how do you sleep at night?	You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I know you from somewhere?	You may have known my father, William Starks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you know my father?	Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father used to talk about you.	Oh yeah, what'd he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What should they be looking for?	They should just be looking harder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You done with your small talk?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is really happening, isn't it?	[Beat] What do you need me to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!	Mom, he just fixed our car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jackie, go play in the snow.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...	You two ok?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your mom take anything before this happened?	Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?	Jackie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I like it I guess.	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I can remember what's on them.	William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I looked it up.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But no one knew until after...	After I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
[Beat] You bled to death.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long do we have?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me, too.	Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're not here.	They're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What are you thinking?	There're no cars on this street.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They've got lives to be grateful for.	William, you're not making sense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going?	To the hospital.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta stop thinking like that.	Then, where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been ok.	Good. How's your mom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.	Ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think so.	You're bleeding pretty bad there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doin'?	I'm doing fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And if I didn't want to come?	I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.	You're not crazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, what would you do?	I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.	So it's helping?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What case?	I was working with a boy named Eugene.
<EOC>	<EOC>
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who...who kills me?	You have nothing to fear, William.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not gonna let that happen.	You still don't believe me, do you?
I do believe you...	No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tried to kill my wife.	Don't you go to jail for that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What were you talking about the other day?	I wasn't talking about anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gonna be sticky.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Geez, how's that for a fucking ""thank you""?"	Is it true?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever been to jail?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?	Where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you drive?	Sure.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at this shit.	What the hell is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.	How did I get in this taxi?!

Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?	Drive!  DRIVE!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you please repeat the destination?	Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!

<EOC>	<EOC>
Lori...	Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.	Do what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.	Lori, move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...What do you say?	I'm late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Some men just tried to kill me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You call this a paranoid delusion?!	Doug...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose you're not here either.	I'm here at Rekall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doug...Bob McClane.	Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?	Blondes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!	I guess he didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...What?	There's something I have to tell you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't remember you.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?	Hauser left me a note.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.	Not any more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said get out!	Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you didn't like me.	If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you dropped by to apologize?	Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	Jump!

<EOC>	<EOC>
Not bad, for a hooker.	I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's lying.	You two-faced-bastard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?  Are you still you?	I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?!	The reactor.
What reactor?!	The one in the mine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Where's this ""reactor"" come from?"	Aliens built it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure about this?	It's just up ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is the suitcase you gave me.	I gave you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or a big mother slug maybe?	Some kind of mutation...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys all set?	Ready as we'll ever be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much you think?	I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that, anyway?	Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?	My cannon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knock it off, Burt!	I think I scared it!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not going over there, right?	No.  We go straight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So...now what?	Could we make it to the mountains?
<EOC>	<EOC>

You're gonna get us hung up.	Do not talk to the driver.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So long, cactus!	Adios, bridge!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeez, look at that guy.	One job I'd never take is working around electricity.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch your ass, shithead.	Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...	Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.

<EOC>	<EOC>
It worked!  There they go!	LET'S DO IT!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I brought it... to the coroner.	An hour after you picked it up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're fishing. You don't know shit.	I know about Esparza.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or this -- is this a significant difference?	No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?	It most certainly is.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?	Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ms. Vin's sister.	I have to talk to your brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gimme back my bottle.	Let go of my hair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't hurt him.	Where's the nearest hospital?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?	Eddie... I don't know about this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That DD-5.	What, the lunatic who --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have to do that?	"""Have to""? No..."

His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.	-- You found his mugshot?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eddie Dowd.	Roger Baron.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?	Neither.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Murder witness.	You're doing a murder case?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Find him?	Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.	I don't need sleep!
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.	Screw you too, Kitty.

No.	"""No,"" what?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm dying out there.	It's okay, Eddie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- How could I help you?	By trusting me. Shit, man...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.	The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In those days, they often worked as a team.	And who was Arturo Esparza?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	No? Then what did he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You getting this?	-- Every word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay. It was always like that.	Shouldn't one of us...?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Here he comes.	Here he comes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?	Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can do it right here.	Bobby...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bobby's got it.	Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?	Yep, it sure is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You try that you little monkey.	I think I'll take off my badge as well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations. I heard about that.	YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
<EOC>	<EOC>
HE'S GONE.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And no one found the ring?	No, sir, we did not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sort of shorthand.	Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.	How do you figure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lil was wearing a sour face.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agent Desmond, it's...	It's late, Sam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She lived alone.	She must have known someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You better dust this place, Sam.	I'll get my kit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take a look at this.	She's wearing a ring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.	I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe I better start our homework.	Okay, I suppose I should go home.

Laura?	Donna, are you my best friend?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to talk?	No, I want to smoke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Muffin.	No, you're the muffin.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are the Cookies?	You mean Fred and Ginger?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Nothing.

I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.	Not you, Donna, not you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice night.	Yep...  Yes...  It is.

You missed somethin', Ed.	I did? I didn't see anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My secret diary. There are pages missing.	Who would do that?
Bob.	But Bob isn't real.
The pages are gone. That's real.	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.	Hey, Jacques...
"No ""Jacques"". I am the Great Went."	I am The Muffin.

What's going on?	I just can't, James. I can't do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.	What?

You want to see...	See what?

Who was that?	A friend from school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure you're okay?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Laura. What's wrong this morning?	Stay away from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.	NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Leland, what are you doing?	Look at this finger here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Who am I?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Objection, we've...	...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...	...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Concannon...?	Nothing further, your Honor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No further questions.	You may step down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything special about the case?	When she...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Thompson...?	It was good of you to meet...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you don't want me to stay on.	No. No. Thank you. You go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I read the hospital report on your client.	...Deborah Ann Kaye...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you...	...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?	To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi. How are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yessir. I'm sorry.	Why is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is the Plaintiff ready?	Ready, your Honor.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got to work...	Do you want me to go...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe...  Joe...	Stop pressuring me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're pressuring yourself...	No... no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it over?	No.
What are you going to do?	I don't have a goddamned idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	I have to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Galvin's...	Let me talk to Mickey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to buy you a drink.	Thanks, Franky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well, well. Huh?	Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.	That's for sure, Frank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to talk to you.	What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.	Don't touch anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened, Joey...?	I can't talk now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you holding up?	I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?	The broad has disappeared...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing here?	We got to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing in New York...?	Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, there - open up!	Come on out!  We're friends!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look kinda lost yourself.	But I think I know where she'll be....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that it over there?	Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do know him...slightly.	What's he like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does it happen cars are running?	Automobile ignitions are insulated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long was I out?	Hours.  I've been so scared...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what knocked the phones out, too.	How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?	No.  I thought you had them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colonel - shooting's no good!	It's always been a good persuader.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must be somebody in there.	Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'll we say to 'em?	Welcome to California!
<EOC>	<EOC>
One of mom's cups got broken.	I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?	Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if it isn't over?	Maybe you should tell me your dream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heather?	Chase. Hi...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	I'll be there in three hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does he have to stay here over night?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
no.	You have a fever, sweetie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone's coming.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rex saved me.	Rex?  Who's Rex?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time for sleep.	Say how they find their way back home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tomorrow night.	No.  Tonight.  It's important!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	The mean old man with the claws.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.	Don't let the bedbugs bite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's on his way.	He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.	Not sleepy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!	You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
In my bed.	Your bed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And...what's the man doing?	Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why does God let there be bad things?	I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Home.	Home, that's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?	Coming for you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dylan, where's the man?	Here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...what is that?	A story?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Darker.  More...evil?	Yeah...how'd you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Freddy, for all I know.	Steady...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy...	Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know how Chase really died.	What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.	Yeah, sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heather Langenkamp?	Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to see the body.	No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Studio B.	Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?	No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, I can't.	Listen, dammit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heather, what is it?	Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did we lose anybody?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like weather.	Yep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.	He knows.
You sound so sure.	I am about this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You may not like what you hear.	I can take it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are they doing?	Claiming their place in the world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...	Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...	Give me some time to blow the man down...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone aboard young Bill?	Yes, Sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?	I didn't know sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!	Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carry on.	Yes sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you drop any sail?	Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?	My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?	Fifteen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!	It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's still a way.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Make us proud.	Yes sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She isn't that old.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going?	To take a piss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?	Believe what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah.  How'd you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ninety-six.	Congratulations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, I never had friends like this.	Me either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, shut up will ya?	It was a bad dream...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we talk?	I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen man, I think I have a problem.	We all have problems.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have your ticket?	Yes.
Passport?	Look, I just better go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.	I know you will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is going on?	Maybe it's an air raid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	I can't watch this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way!	Come on man, what'd they look like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you do?	"I said ""Sorry, wrong room"" and walked away."
<EOC>	<EOC>
My parents don't do it anymore.	How do you know?  They might.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you from any way?	Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are they doing?	I can't make it out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't go in there.	What are you talking about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.	Yes sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah... Northeast... sir.	Speak up boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Northeast sir!	Unfurl the squares!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	All stop on the engine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	It was my fault.  I slipped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, huh.	Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's on your mind?	I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't do it.	Sir...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you think I'm sending him home?	He killed the dolphin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Phil know how you guys feel?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chicken is a fool's game captain.	So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.	Your cannons made a compelling argument.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, you don't like steak?	I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.	Why are you here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you were too hard on Weathers.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!  What's happening?!!	You're officer of the watch, George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son-of-a-bitch.	We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.  She's got guns.	She's Cuban.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me, too.	Why would you do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.	Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ever call me stupid.	Come on, he didn't mean anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.	Shut up donut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"If you've got ""a broad"" available I'll take her."	Like you'd know what to do with one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They tell you that?	I figured it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It matters to me.	Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, man?	I don't have to listen to this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't.	You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.	It seems we're short on singers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tie it off!!	Outer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.	Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.	No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.	It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?	About anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long you been standing there?	Long enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's outta here!	Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have something to say?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Swing up, son.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it going to be?	I'm sorry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you blubbering about?	I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you hating this?!  Are you!	I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you didn't do anything about it?	No.  I didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.	This be it?
Y'all take American Express?	Yessir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's Cao Ben?	How old are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Whisper it... Whisper ""fuck me""... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper..."	Fuck me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm from all over.	You was in the Marines, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need a hand?	Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How 'bout a beer?	That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?	No, haven't heard of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.	Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice of you to drop by.	Told ya I would. You still riled?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.	Muchas gracias.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No big buildings like in New Orleans.	Whattaya do there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.	Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, many things...	Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is my permiso.	Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?	Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In what capacity?	In many capacities.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?	Why not? How was the fishin'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that?... Who know's your here?	I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.	You ain't actin', mama.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why we sittin' here, mama?	Thinkin' a second, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey baby...	Peanut...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...are followin' him around.	Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ready for this?	We'll find out in a hurry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, Sailor.	One bad car accident...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get ahold a' her quick.	You think she's gonna make it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.	No radio or TV...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That you, Sail, honey?	The only one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sailor? You know what?	I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You been drinkin', huh?	Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must be my son.	Shake hands with your daddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.	Lead the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
LULA!!!!	SAILOR!!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.	Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?	No... But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey. What are you guys doing here?	We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You snore.	So I hear.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.	He's right, you look horrible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the Chancellor.	Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're welcome.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tripp!	How are you, Crabtree?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Emily?	Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.	Perfect. Well then, shall we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??	It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trip??	She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?	This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.	Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He has a book.	I know. He started it Fall semester.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?	Shut up and drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was good.	He heard everything we were saying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this guy's problem?	Just go around him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	Back up. Go out the other way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait here. I'll be right back.	Where would we go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tripp?!	Shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stay there.	What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.	What's to tell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crabtree.	Ye-es?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he awake?	I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up, James.	So what's the problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who do you think it is?	The Chancellor's here? Now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want some help with that?	Don't touch it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?	Call it a hunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kind of a sign, you're saying.	In a sense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.	Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You peeked, didn't you?	I peeked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vernon.	Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who's got a gun?	You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the hell is that?	A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?	Shoot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.	No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sure.	Stop calling me Vernon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...reconcile with Emily.	Are you there to not reconcile with her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cold, James?	A little.
So what are you doing out here?	It's colder in there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that really it?	That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day?	So I'm told.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're glass. The buttons.	Like the lady herself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?	Yea, James.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...	What's he saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're welcome.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want me to get that?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that?	Well done, James.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't this...?	Hm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She seemed to take it pretty well.	Yeah, well, actually...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Humboldt County?	Maybe...
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.	Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.	Jesus, James. Wow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The one that left you?	That's right. That one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...	How can you tell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You coming?	In a minute. Get us a table.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's because you don't eat.	I eat.
When?	When nobody's looking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going?	Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor Tripp...?	Yes, James.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for that. He all right?	I think so... What about you?
Me? Sure. Why?	Just checking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.	James'll know about George Sanders.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what are you going to do?	Do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.	Oh. Well. I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Grady!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He cribbed that from Borges.	It beats 'What's your major?'
<EOC>	<EOC>
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.	That good, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor Tripp.	Chancellor.
I got the message you called.	I got the message you called too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
New?	Walter just got it back from the framer today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You go first.	All right. This morning --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure.	Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Emily left me this morning.	She's left before...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's gun is that?	It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.	Caps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pow.	You got me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that sitting in your car?	James Leer.
What's he doing out there?	I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sara.	I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He told you.	He told me.
And what did you say?	I said it didn't sound like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch. How many?	Dozens. It's very sad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I went and looked at some babies just now.	Oh?
I guess you have to go on faith.	Some times...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you tell Walter?	I told Walter.
Does he still love you?	It didn't come up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't deserve me, you know.	I know, but sometimes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a nice greenhouse.	It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's he barking at now?	He's still barking at me. He's blind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need a ride.	I'm your man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean because his career's ruined and all?	Jesus. Is that what he told you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walter?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.	Oh... yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it good?	I don't know. It might be...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that guy?	Her husband.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?	Taking the long way home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo, Traxler.	Hey, Professor Tripp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you get high, Sam?	Only when I'm working.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit. Are you serious?	As a heart attack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you riding with me, James?	No, I'm going ho --
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's so many...	Just a few then. The big ones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, is that a school?	K through sixth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.	Something wrong with that?
I was just thinking of... the noise.	I like the noise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	This little table is one heavy bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cherry.	Huh?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.	It's a nice table.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?	No thanks.
Ah, come on.	I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got some good news.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you glad?	When?
Soon.	Next week? The week after?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carlos, can I ask you something?	Sure.
Nothing.	Ask me. Ask me anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean?	I mean... feelings.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you looking at?	Birds.
There's a million birds here.	In that birch tree is a nest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's little chicks!  You want to see?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd love to hear it.	It's a bright sound.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See anything interesting?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you writing in that book?	It's my bird book.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.	Robin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiya, Walter.	Cop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up?	Have a seat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know?	I have no idea.
I think you do.	Why don't you just tell me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't broken any laws.	Then you won't mind if I look around.
I would.	Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?	I could get a search warrant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cherry?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not for sale.	Who said I wanted to buy it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Too much sun.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You walked home.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You knew her?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wasn't feeling well.	I could take you downtown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.	I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?	You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.	It's a free country, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The passionate one?	Yes.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.	I count my blessings.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you don't know nothing about this?	'Fraid not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. How are you adjusting?	I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?	Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?	It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?	You are in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen Walter?	Lovers' quarrel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
People have the right to know.	If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, like the bird.	Can I ask how old you are?
I'm twelve.	No you're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.	Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.	That's okay... doesn't matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.	Does he?
Yes.	Do you like it when he asks you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's her name?	Ms. Kramer.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But will he... ?	Your daddy will always love you.
How do you know?	I know because... it's just something I know.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.	Robin, listen to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walter?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	I don't mind.
You should go home.	Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.	Will I see you again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.	What?
I'd like you to keep a journal.	A diary?
That's right.	No way.
Why not?	Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
I don't understand.	Ev-i-dence.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.	Of course.
It was just an idea.	Bad idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.	Reflect.
That's right.	You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.	How's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Try it.	No fucking way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the journal?	I'm still thinking about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	What did you think would happen?
I don't know.	What did you want to happen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're very late.	Sorry.
Please don't do it again.	I said I was sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Close your eyes.	What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.	Why?
To relax.	I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.	Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who do you see?	I see my sister.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing there?	Did you and your sister often take naps together?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ever do that again.	All right.
I don't like nobody behind my back!	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get an erection?	I was six years old!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's going to take time, Walter.	Time.
How do you feel about that?	I feel... okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Are you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a ride?	I'm all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something wrong with this picture.	What picture?
I'm talking about you.	Me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're quiet at work.	I'm just quiet.
You don't hang out with the other guys.	Neither do you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never spoke to me before.	I thought you were a dyke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You plan to drink both those beers?	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about bears?	What about them?
They could eat you.	Yeah, they could.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something happened to you.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not easily shocked.	I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?	Why do you want to know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, you're not a dyke.	Not tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the problem?	You think I have a problem?
Do you?	It's been a while since...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me about it.	Maybe later.
How about in the morning.	The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.	What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, there.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want to know?	Because I like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the worst thing you ever did?	The worst?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what did you do?	I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not joking.	Twelve years in prison is no joke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, you can go now.	How many girls did you molest?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.	How young?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never hurt them. Never.	Twelve years in prison?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?	No. Never again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was prison like?	You don't really --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've changed.	Why young girls, Walter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...	Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?	I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?	No. That's what I used to tell myself.
And what do you tell yourself now?	Nothing. It's over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, this is crazy.	What?
Being here, with me.	I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.	What odds?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe this isn't a good idea.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're scared.	I'm not scared.
Neither am I.	Maybe you should be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should live together.	Live together.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a bad idea.	I think it's a fucking good idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't even know how to live with myself.	Just think about it.
I've got problems.	Who doesn't?
Most people don't have my kind of problems.	Guess that makes you pretty special.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I say we call it quits.	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	What's it look like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're such an asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be scared, Walter.	I'm not scared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do that.	Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.	What's your fucking problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't sleep well.	Do you want to talk about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard they were filthy birds.	Not when they fly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.	Piece of cake, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.	Where're you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You done impressing yourself, ace?	No way that could just be seawater.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you guys doing?	I'm alright, I'm dealing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got it?!  You got it?	Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice shot, Lins.	What is that?  You drop your dive light?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay so far.	How deep's the drop-off here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we?	Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lord Almighty.	Hey, you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.	Not for long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you were worried about me.	That must be it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't worn mine in months.	Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.	Cute, Virgil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.	Yeah?  Well I'm not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You dumb jarhead motherf--	Chill out, Lindsey!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think it likes you.	It's trying to communicate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's jammed the mechanism.	Now what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You owe me one, Virgil.	Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You totaled it, huh?	Yeah.  So sue me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.	You noticed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that's that.	Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good hundred yards, I'd say.	They'll come out after us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see where it's coming in?	Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son of a bitch!	Calm down, Bud.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--	NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is insane.	It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, Lins... I--	Tell me later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Bud, no... not you.	Who then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Brigman.	Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll go in through that large breach.	Let's go, guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.	Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you find Wilhite?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Virgil?	God, I hate that bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, man.  What else could it be?	Why bring it here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's convulsing!	It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Fish'?	Yuh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.	I can't... make it... podner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You better not say you missed that.	Missed what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quiet!  Quiet!	Turn it up, bozo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SHIT!	Give me that!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cab One, radiation readings?	Neutron counter's not showing very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, oh...	What kind of luminous things, Bud?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	Check this out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of light?	He's hallucinating badly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But your friend is waiting downstairs.	She'll wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you?	Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But where are you going?	I'm thirsty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one shall I wear?	This one is gorgeous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claudia, aren't you coming?	I'm certainly not going to swim across.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And how long will you be away?	Four or five days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that one over there called?	That must be Basiluzzo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be so humble.	How should I be ... arrogant?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Find anything?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claudia, listen to me...	No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then I'll see you later.	Okay. In a few minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sandro ...What's the matter?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Sandro... Please...	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, my love.	Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I love you.	Tell me once more.
I don't love you.	I deserve it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?	I would say he's pretty depraved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But where did you finally end up?	It was futile. We went all over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's divine!	You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not coming.	But then why did you bother changing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?	Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.	What do you mean by sensible?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?	I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you talking to?	To the shark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, you come too...	But for what reason should I come there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.	But why all nudes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's as smooth and slick as oil.	I detest comparisons made with oil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll stay here also.	But why?... What if it starts to rain?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what are we going to do now?	We'll try again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she going?	Ask her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Giulia...	Here I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have a radio like this, too.	No, not like this one.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?	Because this is a Chinese radio.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you the owner of this place?	No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?	From Panarea. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why have we stopped?	Lady Patrizia!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zuria?	Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.	Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She costs a hundred thousand lire.	You're kidding!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm being punished.	Why?
I don't know.	Dear Jesus...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have a lovely voice.	No I don't.
I just heard you.	That wasn't me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No I'm not.	Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.	What would you like to talk about.
I don't know.	Anything... may I sit down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know a Marie?	No... do you?
Why should I?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do?	I'm always bad.
What did you do?	I breathed!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And then what happened?	We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.	I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Someone's following me.
Who?	Sister Marguerite I think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?	No... don't hit me please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agnes, can you hear me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She said Michael.	What did she mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you frightened?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was dead.	It was alive wasn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	If I find anything I'll call you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Martha, it's you.	What about Roger? He's free.
<EOC>	<EOC>
???	I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, no...	I can get you new evidence next week.
No!	Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh that one there, in the corner.	The one up on the third floor?
Yes.	Uh huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were a smoker?	Two packs a day.
I can beat that.	Unfiltered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's absurd!	That possibility never occurred to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This was before her pregnancy?	About two years before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, what do you need.	Answers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's nothing here.	Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...	What is it?
The sheets...	What sheets?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And my permission?	I'd like yours too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll see about that.	Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.	The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.	I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?	Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.	Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?	Would it stop you if I did?
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I be present?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is permission to take her apart.	Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?	I have a few more questions to ask her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's enough.	Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.	What happened to the baby?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, don't do this!	Wasn't it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lay them down.	Eh?
Lay them down.	We'd be thrown out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're yours.	They are?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why aren't you at work?	I'm a deserter, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about all these letters?	Read 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you fix him for me?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.	And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't think...	They'll be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ever seen one of these before?	Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.	I've made the scene.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me? Why?	Bag-snatcher.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't snore.	You do - repeatedly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?	No. I don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gerron.	No, straight up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure. .	Ah well. Eh, look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up?	He's sulking again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ringo!	Wake up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.	You crawler.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well ... come on.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.	Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I say it?	Follow your impulse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.	I'll look in here again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we waiting for?	Come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning!  Who's that little old man?	It's Paul's grandfather.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I didn't you did ...	Well, what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	Eh, there's only three of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!	Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Go away! You've spoilt it.	Oh, sorry I spoke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you off to?	I'm going parading before it's too late!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Lip reading.
What are they saying?	Nothing good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you two like a cup of tea?	You see, sly villains.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Grandfather!	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And we're looking after him, are we?	I'll look after meself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.	Every morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And another thing, where's that old mixer?	Here, Pauly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, that's his other one.	That's all right then.
Clean though, isn't he?	Oh yes, he's clean all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that yours?	For Ringo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, he looks a right lurker.	You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing there?	Hiding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?	Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!	He's got you worried, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give 'em a pull.	Shall I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope he fell off.	Don't be callous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go and muck in.	Aye, before anyone stops us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Behave...	Foreign devil ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's going to show me her stamp collection.	So's mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you listening to me, Lennon?	You're a swine, isn't he George?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?	Of course, he's concealed about me person.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.	Well you're not going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now get on with it.	We were going to do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's have you.	Come on speedy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.	Sit down, the lot of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Norm!	Hi, our lot!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a window rattler, son.	Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'll only get you into trouble.	Aah, shurrup, misery!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's betrayed the class.	Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!	Well ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well!	He'll get over it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have <U>you</U> lost him?	Don't exaggerate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh, where's my grandfather?	Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got the stuff. Come here.	Aren't we ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's my grandfather?	Don't start. Look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
None for me, then?	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's mine.	Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well ...	When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop picking on him.	I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think are you're up to?	Someone put it on me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look after him.	But...
Do I have to raise me voice?	Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, you want to watch it.	It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.	I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's been gone a long time.	Who?
Paul's grandfather.	Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...	Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...	Well, give a couple of minutes ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.	Clever.  George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that?	Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh, what's all this?	Oh, him... He's been lurking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh... God... am I cold...	Is that you, Roby?
I feel like shit...	Yeah, it's you all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.	Cattle ranch!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Locked.	Kill drive engines.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Irth?	Sandy, scan the whole sky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't recognize that constellation.	Dell, plot our location.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got it.  Oh boy.	Where the hell are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you get it a little closer?	That's what I'm going to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any rotation?	Yeah.  Two hours.
Gravity?	Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Close enough to walk to!	Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?	Receiving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go first.	No, you'll follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just machinery.	But functioning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we can get in by the top.	You want to try?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel, Dell?	Wretched.  What happened to me?
Don't you remember?	Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Breathe deeply.	<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have recorded the transmission.	Play it for us, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Computer, what language was that?	Unknown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.	What?  <u>Why</u>?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes!	I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.	Has the hull been breached?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long to fix?	Hard to say.
Well, get started.	Right.  Talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Faust!	Yeah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>He</u> died.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	That way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to the lights?	Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- God -- oh --	Is it alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no.  Oh, no.	What was that?  What the Christ was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And then we run out of food and oxygen.	The water will still recycle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's really on there tight.	Here, let me try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, guess what?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Might even incinerate the damn thing.	I hope not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did it come from?	<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, that smoke's poisonous!	It's eating a hole in the floor!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's over, Hunter.	Boy, that's terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey now, what is this?	Ask him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.  Should be coming through about there.	Careful, don't get under it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.	I'll come with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got six hours left.	Oh my God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.	Should we go outside and bring him in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The flamethrower!	I can't, the acid will pour out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what's wrong?	I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?	I'm trying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!	How many?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening up here?	I think it's fizzled out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is horrible.	Hey!  what about the film?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What common objects?	Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't count on it.	We sure need this flamethrower.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?	Feast your eyes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
First contact...	Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?	Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That way.	You lead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	My signal's fading.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's close, real close.	How far?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Air lock?	Who knows?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say?	I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>What is it</u>?	<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It won't come -- it's stuck.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thank God... just missed him.	Is it still dripping?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.	We're going into the freezers now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How?	Room by room, corridor by corridor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We do know that.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we?	Sandy, contact traffic control.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God.	Well, it's finally happened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's out of focus.	No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.	Turn on navigation lights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell happened?	Engine room, what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Martin, uh, we've found it.	Found what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Find anything we missed?	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Still worried?	Oh well... you know me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I understand why you did that.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take us up.	Up one kilometer, Jay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Engaged.	Let's take her into an escape orbit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	What do you think?  Now we go in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did it get so <u>big</u>?	By eating our food supplies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two down, four to go.	What's that supposed to mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which presumably means...	... More spores coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Hey watch it</u>!	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill me...	What did it do to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Headache?  Dehydration?	The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a rhino.	Is it dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get back and call this in.	Wait a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Minh...	Yep...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?	Okay, give me the numbers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you need?	A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seal everything now!	What's happening?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.	We're what!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many of them are there?	Too many.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give or take.	We're not gonna make it, are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she?	Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found it...	And?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.	Get her on-line.  Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.	Keep trying!
<EOC>	<EOC>
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.	Shit.  When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Picking up velocity.	Match it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too late!	Nooooo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.	Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.	Do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
De Vries?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something spooking the rhinos?	I dunno.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Guttierez?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa, wait a minute...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, okay.  Look...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I'm going first...	Anything you say, Mammacitta.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Careful of that edging there...	Yeah, I got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold it, hold it...	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?  Where?	Just behind us, over to the right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?	Yeah, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.  Lost it.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this the suit?	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And...?	And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They've changed their heading again.	Compensate!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They knocked out the external feeds.	Looks like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, we're in business.	Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, I'm out of here!	Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	Real man' drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seltzer?	Want some?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.  Somebody won.	Check out the tent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've found Ackland!	Hold on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the wrong way!	Detour.  Other way's blocked...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry it up.	Don't wait for me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going?	Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know my name?	It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?	Phoebe.
Phoebe?	I call myself Phoebe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just like that, eh?	Just like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feeling better, my dear?	Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?	That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was magnificent.	Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.	You were there? At the play - last night?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill!	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've already met.	Where?
Right here. A minute ago.	That's nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck, genius...	Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing?	Everything... everything's so funny...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only in some ways. You're prettier...	I'm a junk yard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.	Like a nylon lemon peel-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knit me a muffler.	Call me when you get in...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a good thought.	It won't play.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy little housewife...	Cut it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What fire and music?	You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Addison-!	So full of meaning, fire and music!
<EOC>	<EOC>
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.	Glory Hallelujah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?	What would you like? Texas?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, what's your name?	Eve. Eve Harrington.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I read George Jean Nathan every week.	Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.	You didn't have to tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for your help... good luck.	Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme fix you a drink.	No thanks, Birdie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-	I never played Fort Sumter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You need new girdles.	Buy some.
The same size?	Of course!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do, my dear.	Oh, brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.	Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill the people.  Got your key?	See you home...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Birdie-	Hmm?
You don't like Eve, do you?	Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.	No.
Why not?	Now you want an argument.
She works hard.	Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-	Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?	Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	Miss Harrington...
What are you doing here?	I - I guess I fell asleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The maid'll fix it in the morning.	I'll just pick up the broken glass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the door.	You rest. I'll get it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you'd forgotten about me.	Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Miss Channing.	My husband...
<EOC>	<EOC>
If I only knew how...	Try...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?	It couldn't possibly interest you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have your coat?	Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.	They certainly don't waste much time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Addison wants me to play it.	Over my dead body...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, Eve.	Thank you, Karen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Miss Harrington.	How do you do, Mr. Richards.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... it started with the play before this one...	'Remembrance'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.	I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...	Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.	They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you'd like.	I wouldn't like.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.	I had no idea you knew each other.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?	Harrington.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want it on?	It doesn't matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I remember.	You'll be there, won't you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was the concert?	Loud.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coming?	In a minute...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well of all-	Margo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
- well? What happened?	Nothing much. She apologized.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's so funny?	Nothing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it? What's it all about?	Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...	... Among so many quiet qualities.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karen and I just don't want an accident-	I have no intention of having an accident!
<EOC>	<EOC>
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.	You know, she probably means well, after all...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That depends.	I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.	"Well. I don't want to play ""Cora."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?	I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carl?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
--what do you think?--	--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--	--a spy, you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
July of '71.	About the past year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	The fucking New York Times.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't get it... this really was my turf...	You're not a kid anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate both parties.	And I'm a Republican.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Republican?	Sure.
Who'd you vote for?	When?
'68.	Nixon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did he just say what I think he said?	You voted for him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--there had to be a White House overseer--	--Colson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll give us a sworn statement.	We're inside the White House now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think that's him.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
--Jesus--	--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You overslept?	Goddamnit!--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?	Whatever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?	He is not in the car.  Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?	Well of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Donald Segretti?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--	--that was awhile ago--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--you got more than one source?--	--yes--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Speak.	We've just been talking to Young--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--and we got a guy in Justice--	--Deep Throat?--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?	Absolutely--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've really got to go.	Just let me get a match.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But they both worked at the White House?	I will not talk about the other two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I really can't talk now--	--this'll only take one second--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--that leaves Haldeman, period.	I'm not your source on that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	My non-denial denial.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just tell me his title.	I don't know titles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got Clawsen on hold--	--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--what do you think?--	--he went to her apartment and he told her--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--I'm sure--	--I'm not sure, it still feels thin--
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't talk inside either?	Electronic surveillance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your name, please.	James McCord.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?	Security consultant.
Where?	Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?	...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?	The C.I.A.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--	--I'm Woodward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--	--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you get on W.House?	Lotsa hints--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--who you got?--	--well, Sloan--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--has any of them got an ax?--	--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--no--	--can we use their names?--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--which Young?	Larry Young, a California lawyer--
<EOC>	<EOC>
A boy or a girl?	A girl. Melissa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.	No, none of those.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell was that?	Sorry.
No, it was good.	Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good work, Ostreicher.	Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!	-- Thanks, coach --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great evening, isn't it?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you just say?	Suck me...beautiful?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?	I believe the kegs are upstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, I got some scotch.	Single malt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?	Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had no idea you'd be this good!	Neither did I!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your plan, Finch?	Yep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This.  Right now.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...	Seduce her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you suppose they're saying?	No idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Um...Chris --	You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?	You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?	Forget it.
Come on!  I won't tell.	Neither will I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you doing this?	Because I want to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the game?!	I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!	No.  I'm missing the game for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oz, it's okay, I know.	You called me Oz.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jessica, can you drive me home?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.	Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give it to me!  Yes!	Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you love my sexy body?!	I do, baby, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're so big!	Yeah, that's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck me!  Yes!	Uh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's our man.	Finch, you got the Latin homework?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gotta go.	But --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow, what the hell?	Sorry, I thought you were dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.	Right.  That gives us...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, where's Finch?	Went home to shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I miss anything?!	Just in time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.	Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, God.  Let this be it.	He's going in!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	Holy shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, minuteman.	Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know that?	She's already on a plane back home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!	You fuckin' rule!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the heck is this?	Nothing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I come in?	Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?	Dad, come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	These are for you.  From father to son.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know, Dad.	Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad!  I know!	Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.	Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.	Okay, well that about covers it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jim?	It's not what it looks like!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son.  This lady's here for you.	I know.  Hey Nadia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!	I told you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys got the Latin homework?	No -- Kevin, you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.	Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?	Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I still think you're okay.	So do I, Kev.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	I thought so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...you...go...ahead.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.  No.  Yes.	Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you need to change, right?	Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?	For me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh...	Move with the music.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jim...	Oh no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!	God dammit, Stifler!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ho-lee shit.	This just got a hell of a lot better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?	Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.	You think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me know.	Okay, don't stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vicky, wait.	Not for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh...ungghhhhh!	Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!	Just a second!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now?!	No...I know the perfect time...
<EOC>	<EOC>
See -- this is the nicest room.	Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You comfortable?	Yeah, are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you're comfortable?	Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.	Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?	Yeah, right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah Vick?	I want to hear you say it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victoria...I love you.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a great night.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.	Yeah, the time went by so fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.  I got another question for you.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then she said -- she loves me.	Oh shit dude, the L-word!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever hear of something called The Bible?	Once, in church, dude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.	You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Contact, dude.	Then where does a blowjob figure in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feeling better, Oz?	I'm such a loser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So does your tongue cramp up?	Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What reputation?	Observe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Guess what?	I don't care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.	He didn't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess we'll call you two-ply.	Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.	Fuck yeah we will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
NOVA!!	Stifler!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!	Shut the fuck up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.	Come on, you know the words, sing along.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our last game is this Saturday.	No shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, babe.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	Uh huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merde! Just missed!	Uhh! Would you die already!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Either way works for us...	But you better hurry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God. How can you eat like that?	It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?	Yeah. Apparently.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -	AHHHHHHH!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!	Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.	No it isn't! You're dead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Salots! Shitfucker!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Andy! Holy shit!	Serafine...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about your glasses?	It's okay. I can see fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Serafine...	I'll be right back. Stay put.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because, Andy. It's a cure.	A cure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you crazy!?	Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope they fucking fry us all.	Yeah. French fries...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy mother of God...	Fuck me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.	What...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't both have to die.	I couldn't do it. Not to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know where he'll go.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't even have to ask.	All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No wonder he let her go.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God. I can't believe it.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
These tunnels must loop around and connect.	Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. Be careful.	You too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God. Shit...	Andy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!	FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pull over! Now!	Shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claude...?	And you call me a moron...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The ADM. Let's go.	Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the problem?	Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think I'm an idiot?	Sure. Don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another step and he's dead!	Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ha. Some wonder drug...	Why isn't it doing anything!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing's happening!	Looks like he lied to you too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You recognize her?	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Andy...	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uncle Terrence?	Andy? Andy is that you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?	That's McDermott, but yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright. Let me write a letter.	Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -	Allo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.	You fucking liar!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merde.	He says -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	Okay. So maybe you were right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.	Double merde.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry, Grandmama!	Get on! Anastasia, get on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you running away?	No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is your home, Anya?	I'm not sure but look. . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is everyone all right?	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I tell you that?	You must have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! I look ridiculous!	Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.	I shant!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch!  That really hurt!	I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.	Who are you?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want to go to Paris?	I have my reasons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By pulling my hair?!	I was all out of dynamite!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on up!	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just what do you think you're doing?!	Trying... to... breathe...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forged papers! Now, what?!	Now just get off the train.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on!	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must enjoy causing me pain!	You shouldn't have pushed us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every Russian family has one..	Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said you wouldn't laugh!	It's not you - it's the dress!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh! I'm sorry...	It's okay. Didn't hurt..
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm so scared...	Don't be
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.	"I'm glad you	did too."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dmitri?	Anya... where are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't let me go!	I'll never let go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you, child?	I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you, child?	Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dmitri didn't want the money?	No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trust me, it's her!	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's her.	He's her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"She doesn't want to do anything ""dishonest"". . ."	Ew. . .  the honest type.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a princess...	Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.	Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do now?	Pray he's color-blind...
<EOC>	<EOC>
See? The Princess is under there ...	Ah! Let us begin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"The ""Odessa Dunk""?"	It worked in Odessa...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll show you!	Run, Anya -  go...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's on television?	This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Singer!	Alvy Singer over here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's an important issue.	Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Allison.	Yeah? Allison what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.	Well, stop listening to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.	Hey, that was last year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For yuh.	Okay, that's good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...	Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can digest our-	Okay. Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	U-huh.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.	Let's just do it, all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Jesus, really?	Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-me, my God, it's a great day!	Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, this place is great.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, good. Okay.	I'm cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alvy.	Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.	Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd I do?	Step up here!
What'd I do?	You should be ashamed of yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.	Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I'm sorry!	Don't get upset!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably on their first date, right?	It's a narrow view.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.	Tell him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.	This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, watch the road!	You'll total the whole car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.	Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you realize how immoral this all is?	Max, I've got a hit series.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.	Look, uh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!	His wife has diabetes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fired the cleaning woman?	She was stealing.
But she's colored.	SO?
So the colored have enough trouble.	She was going through my pocketbook!
They're persecuted enough!	Who's persecuting? She stole!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.	I look pretty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, don't let it be so long, now.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.	You think so? Do you really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
M'mmm.	I just have time to get the, uh-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.	I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?	I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?	Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So who won?	A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.	Why didn't you come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?	Absolutely.
Had a little help?	Absolutely not.
It has your ring.	I'm not that good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's going.  It's going.	And how's the diva doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She already has.	It's alright, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not.	This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get the kids.	Oh my God, the sitter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you leave us alone right now?	I love her too, Joe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gonna miss his flight.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take good care of it.	Count on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm the hired help.	Fuck you.
I never put myself in harm's way.	Anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That for us?	What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?	Sally?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So?	I love you, Joe Therrian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Let's go upstairs, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The suspense is killing me.	Harry called.
And?	Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.	She's in ICU.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stupid tart.	She left a note.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You need to call your dad.	Leave us alone right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.	Monica.
And you know our friends, how?	We live next door.
Oh.  You're them.	Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.	You have?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.	You have to sign your taxes anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cal, my wife Judy.	Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a test, you know.	Forget it, Judy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go.	Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm fine, babe.	Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.	Anytime, sport.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We closed.	Fantastic.  Out here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not millions.	He's directing now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take your time, Jer.	I'm ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was it?  What the fuck was it?	Ryan's novel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy anniversary, baby.	Happy anniversary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kiss the back of my knees.	Through the sweats or not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.	I'll say as little as possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the kitchen.	Who'd like to go and find Otis?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?	It's taken care of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two minutes.	It's alright.  Be our guests.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still champions.	Panes is not on your team anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dolphins.  Great.	It's ecstasy, Sal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you.	Or shitty!!  Otis!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy anniversary.	It's a Calder.
I know.	He's my favorite.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.	Ah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	Will you make love with me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's a sign for that?	Come on, Panes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffee?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have a gift?	Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lose this?	Ah there's our snookums now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy tiger.	Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Scout's honor.	I'll be your best friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need to leave you now.	I will treasure this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemon or raspberry?	Lemon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.	I'm so sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course it's alright.	Clair is a hovering mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Trust him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't say a word.	Time!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ.	Well...wow...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's he doing?	Not good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ryan.	I'm sure you understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, yes, actually.	He always has two or three going...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!	Don't go in, Ryan.
What?	Let's just go home, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?	Sally?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could hardly say no.	Oh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ryan!	Are you working on a new book?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hors d'oeuvres or something?	Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.	Yes.
I so wish I'd known.	Well, whoever did this is amazing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.	You fucking cow, can't you read?!
I...	How long ago was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there space here?	Yes.
Do you need anything else?	No, no thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was impressed.	Oh?
The charades.	Thank you.
That was my clue.	Oh?
The Shostakovich.	Really??
<EOC>	<EOC>
Panes is here!	Oh great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how are you really doing, Panes?	Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.	I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.	No, really, five thousand with your discount.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Panes.	You don't need to thank me.
We're going to have to go back out there.	I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Panes?	From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Well, so glad you decided to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Monica and Ryan.	Rose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.	I'll be right out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't need to do that.	I don't mind...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enough about me.	Evie has a little something for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone who follows his heart!	Right...because every ant's important!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!	Wait!  When can I see you again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You dance...	Divinely?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Out here I'm just what?	Hlllllllp!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do they have you tied up here?	There's something going on, Z --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is that idiot?	Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bala!	Mom!
<EOC>	<EOC>
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!	Don't get all sappy about it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Z!  Over here!	Barbatus?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.	Duty calls!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?	Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So tell me.  Where's Z?	I...I have no idea, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I cut in?	Oh, of course --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ask me why we're so successful.	Why are we so successful?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see out there?	...Ants...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We declared war again?  Are you scared?	I'll be back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, did you hear what he said?!	Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wear this.	You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.	What do I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!	You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This the place?	Yeah.  How much?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not there.  Under the mat.	Under the mat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So this is your mother's apartment?	That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.	Something the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning, Mr. Baxter.	Morning, Miss Kubelik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should have stayed in bed this morning.	I should have stayed in bed last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night.	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One more?	I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right? What's the matter?	Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	The mirror -- it's broken.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --	I just want to go brush my teeth --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here. How about some breakfast?	No -- I don't want anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When are you coming home?	As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?	No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?	They had to pump it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I'm going to give it all up.	Give what up?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?	Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
I don't want it.	Pick a card.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you want to throw that card?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that?	Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a call for you --	For me?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.	I don't want to talk to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I light the candles?	It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see you bought some napkins.	Might as well go all the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?	Fine. How's your eye?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	I'm fine.
Are you sure? How's your knee?	I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?	Of course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Miss Kubelik.	Seven --  -- queen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --	Relax, Baxter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now you're being bright?	Thank you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baxter?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no -- just had a little accident.	What does he mean, accident?
<EOC>	<EOC>
On account of me.	You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.	Oh, I'm very grateful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Baxter.	What do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She going to be all right, Doc?	How many pills were in that bottle?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's her name?	Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Miss Kubelik.	Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any of that coffee left?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you spell her last name?	Kubelik -- with two k's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the patient?	Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not so rough, honey.	Good night.
Good night?	The party's over.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?	It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say, what's going on here, anyway?	Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That guy really must've belted him.	Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sleeping pills.	That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Doctor.	Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.	Get more coffee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me again -- what's my name?	Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?	I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?	No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fool -- you damn fool.	Come on, Fran.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have that date -- remember?	I love you -- remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a drink ?	Sure, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Winning the war by yourself.	Part.
Which part is that ?	My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's good gin.	I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Delta ?	No.
North ?	Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?	None.
Rangers, eh?	Sort of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you Longe Range Recon --	No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a light down there --	Yeah, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie?	Looks that way.
Who's he?	God knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.	Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say?	Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smoke !	Where ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you trying to say, Captain --	You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're not Cong.	We're Americans.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.	When'd you do it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --	Thta's not Charlie's work --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody see some smoke ?	Too far inland.
<EOC>	<EOC>

One night with me!	You think you're kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you...  Let him take you home.	Don't want to. I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?	Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.	So am I, Frank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's Verdell doing?	He's a pain in the ass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?	Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening.	Hi. You have hard shells, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Actually, I don't think so.	Wait here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I get her for you?	No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Yeeeess!!!	Maybe this can wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.	Well, that's a load off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.	Thank you for walking him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.	It smells like shit in here?
Go away.	That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.	Where are all your queer party friends?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I carry bacon in my pocket.	Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.	Come on, sweetheart...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you leave now, please?	Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's very thoughtful.	Never a break. Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you gotta camp it here...	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.	They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You going to come talk to me or not?	I'm coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>

How in the fuck do you know that?	Do you want Rath or not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where have you been, Robert?	Sick.  The flu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.	I'm worried about you, Robert.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	The contract was stolen.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>

Do you have a passport?	Several.
Good.	Where is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Not even a stalemate?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think he's here?	Here?

Would you like a drink?	I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you ever think about starting over?	All the time.

<EOC>	<EOC>
It must be on the other side of this.	But how did the wall get here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need any disks?	Yeah, I'll take some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perfect!	It looks new, they might miss one or two.
We're going to need it all.	Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Like a hand?	When your ready Son!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.	You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red or white?	Both, see you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you cleared all the rubble up?	No, not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>

No, We aren't going to do it.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.	You capitalist pig!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Jahn's thing have a name?	Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Lawrence is getting derogatory again.	Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to get in trouble.	Don't worry it's okay!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope you're going to invite me in?	Everybody is at home, it's no good.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Beer please! Do you want another drink?	Fernet and tonic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I love you, really.	Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought for sure they would catch me.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will it help to get you out?	I hope so!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't understand, it's your home?	There's nothing there for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget about me Kat.	But I love you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?	Sure, I've done it easily.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do my best. Is the place open.	Yep, it's all yours.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Any chance of getting me out on bail?	What is bail?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll put one on the notice-board too.	Am I invited?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought I'd help out.	We don't need you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it dry?	Yeah seems okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What would you like, beer?	No, just a coffee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd better get you to a hospital.	I'll be okay, just get me home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.	I had it coming from someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who you saving the dishes for?	Guests.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you have a girlfriend?	Sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you take your things over to my place?	Uh-huh!
Run into Josh?	Yeah, but it was okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better than you.	Hmm, I still owe him.
Why don't we both forget about him?	Alright!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weren't you going to get some glasses?	Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you steal the car?	It's Josh's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your doing?	Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?	That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.	Fuck you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you break into that particular building?	It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?	A kind of freedom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not sure it's possible.	The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like your things now?	Yeah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Doug, where you been?	Working....Under cover.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, he didn't fire you?	No way, he even gave me back pay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Josh!	Well come on, sit down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to go.	It's time to go home, Holly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on Holly!	Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's my bag.	Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.	You bastard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I look after the rest?	Don't you dare, I'll be back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you come home and forget all about him?	Yes, if you can get him free.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are responsible...What has happened?	We're not sure...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, who is in the building?	Some Americans?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So go dance.	With you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's coming over here...	Heart be still.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's one girl who can't take a hint.	Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She asleep?	I'll tell her you were here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if they expel you?	Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?	Cuz nothing happened at school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your father dropped off an extra check.	I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --	-- I like the car I have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Out with Belinda?	That's over. Way over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look nice. I should have dressed.	You're fine like that, Mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.	Thanks.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.	Me neither.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To see your father?	No. I won't be long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A late night or an early morning?	Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry. I didn't know.	I didn't know either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told him to leave me alone.	Landon --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.	I need to whizz.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hypotheticals --	I'm just wondering --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't call him a dipshit.	You do --
<EOC>	<EOC>
The address?!	York Ave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Deranged.	Demented.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's like some Puritan.	She's not. She's got her own ideas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.	It was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.	Scamming's a strong word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Landon!	Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.	No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
You.	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm very sorry --	What kind of a man are you, son?
<EOC>	<EOC>
'I hope your dreams come true.'	'They won't.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Is it really me?'	'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --	-- This play means a lot to me.
This play -- ?	-- I know you don't suck at acting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's deep --	-- Your act only works with an audience.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.	Like me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the -- ?!	So you agree you need help?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take a chance.	Go for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what else is on this list?	It's private.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No problem --	And you have to meet my father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll get something for us to drink --	Don't bother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know. Don't say anything.	He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
You think so.	Know so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because I try to be nice to people?	Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	That is my telescope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looking for intelligent life?	Looking for something -- someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're really into God, right?	In ten words or less?
Yeah.	My relationship with God is my own.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.	Don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He doesn't trust you.	Sometimes I don't even trust me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The play's going to be really good.	I'm really glad you think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not in a very good mood.	You don't miss a thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The play's in a couple of weeks.	Yes. And?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Just not at school...	Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.	Belinda's a very jealous person.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So it's like you want to be secret friends.	That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
<EOC>	<EOC>
He okay?	Healthy as can be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were great the other night.	Thank you. So were you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't been nice to you.	You're hardly nice to anyone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
People can see.	And that would ruin your reputation how?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe you inspire me.	That sounds like horseshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All of it.	It's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a start.	Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're talking to me?	When I have something to say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does that mean?!	It means you can do anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	I heard what you did. Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She great or what?	Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like fire.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. But not as a date date.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.	I wanted this to be a date.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your turn.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Before we do this.	We're doing something -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	Fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stand right here.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can measure wind.	Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?	Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't understand...	Maybe you're not supposed to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I might do it wrong.	Not possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You make me feel...	Loved?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Assholes. This happen to you?	Twice a year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you tell your father?	The truth. I just left you out of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you build this?	I was twelve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you want to see?	Mars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.	You planned this --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you trying to seduce me?	No. Why? Are you seducible?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ergo?	What about your father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the best thing I can see tonight?	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you locate XXI5639I?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One of your secrets.	Yes, one of many.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're worried about your college applications.	I'm not applying to college.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jamie --	I'm sick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me live until I die?	I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nope.	Anything you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.	I used to like yogurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you thinking?	That I want you to take me home.
Now? We just --	I don't want to come here anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've talked to your father.	That's what I mean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know how to waltz??	I was going to fake it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing?	Tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're you doing?	Better. I was really angry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gone now.	Because you have hope that you'll get better?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I -- go out?	You'll be fine for a few minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you do something for me?	Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.	He wants help with his lines --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's Landon Carter up to?	Up to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm asking how much.	Dad --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in the play?	Lead man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?	Does it have to do with Jamie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I care for her.	I don't want to see her hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This week.	Ever again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Landon. You're not the quiet type.	No.
So talk to us about something.	Like what, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Landon. You go on home.	I'm not tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?	In there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have materials for the side bearings?	I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know about this stuff?	I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.	She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've been well?	Yes. You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're marrying again.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.	She did. It was you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I can do what I want.	That's right.  The world is your oyster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?	I want to come back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --	-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For Jefferson High. For books.	Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.	I didn't say you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.	You came here to give me my report card?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning Dick.	Marty. What's for breakfast?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's N.R.C.?	I don't know. National Cash Register?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was school today?	Fine.
Learn anything?	Oh yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean you're going to stay up all night?	Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old are you?	Seventeen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's your jacket!	Uh, thanks...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's polyester.	Poly-what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	Have we ever met before?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Marty.	Uh, hi....
<EOC>	<EOC>
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!	But he didn't ask me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.	Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I know exactly what you mean.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!	Coming, Eileen...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, hi, Eileen.	How are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, you seen the drill?	What drill?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine..	Learn anything?
Oh yeah.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The sunrise? What for?	Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've gotta ask her to the dance!	Not now....
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?	It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Bike fine point?'	Bic... It's a Bic pen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe if I used my left....	No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?	Not a holocaust --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have a name?	Marty. Marty Lewis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.	Five cents, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, there's no answer.	Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.	What year?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?	Home, school, here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.	Yeah,  Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Pro! Release the rope!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eight thirty.	AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!	Oh, right, right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Catch you later!	...To be traveled through
<EOC>	<EOC>
But Professor --	Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!	Precisely!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!	Is Shemp all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marty, that would alter history.	So what? We'd be rich!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor? Professor Brown?	You know me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You answered the door!	You were ringing the doorbell!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	You did what?!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no way of knowing.	Perfect...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suzy!	Hi, Marty!
What did you do to your hair?	What did you do to yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promise to stay down there for an hour?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Catch!	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing, Cato?	Not bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get them antlers?	They come with the house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I guess.	She plays the clarinet, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what he told you, huh?	No, he showed me one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.	Okay.
I'll catch up with you.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That your spider in there? In that bottle?	Yeah.
What do you feed him?	Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Does he bite?	He never bit me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We did it, Ray.	You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Kit...	Tom...
Good luck to you.	Thanks.
I mean it.	I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure is pretty.	What'd you come out here for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	What're you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What for?	For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.	Yeah? Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.	Yeah. I can imagine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.	Great.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?	Spanish.
"How do you say ""Quit my Job"" in Spanish?"	Something mi trabajo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to go for a ride?	Well, I got homework.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a redhead.	I know.
"Anybody ever call you ""Red""?"	Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?	Just don't... I've got a headache.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My stomach's growling.	There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody else is going to get it.	I don't care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?	Yeah.
Is that all there is to it?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?	Don't ask me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure?	You don't believe me, see for yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing?	I'm fine. Kind of tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at all this junk.	How's he doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he upset?	He didn't say anything to me about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think I got 'em?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you put him in there for?	Just to keep him out of the sun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?	Well, why you always walking behind me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.	Anybody ever done that to you before?
No.	Positive?
Yes.	Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everybody loves trout.	I'm serious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You smoke Pall Mall?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you got a better idea?	I just don't want to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Course it's too bad about your dad.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Yes?
This your place?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, whatcha doing?	Just thinking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're my friend, aren't you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning... Say, you got any gas?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't walk out here.	It's mine all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, friend. Start running.	Just gimme a chance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hold it right there.
<EOC>	<EOC>

You tossed my hat out the window.	Wanta sue me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!	Who're you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's another one we owe 'em.	They're stealing my chopper!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm starving...somebody, help.	Got a half a tuna sandwich.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what?	Vanished. Thin air.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a welcome sight...	Just 'grazed' you, huh?

We will, old fried, we will.	Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody we know?	Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?	Not really.  This is pretty important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Running a little late, Buckaroo.	Let her out. In my custody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buckaroo--! Sorry--	What is it, Tommy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dead.  Damnit!	Where's the professor?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.	Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going down!  Onto the runway!	The door's locked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?	Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!	What? How do you know that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where're you goin'?	To get my guns.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And they got Penny!  Look!	Don't shoot!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...	Everybody okay up here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was she pretty?	Who?
The girl I remind you of.	She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?	Which?  The one in my throat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You keep an eye on it.	Any time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay here, I'll be back.	Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!	Penny--?!  Are you all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?	I have a radio fix...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not here!  No Overthruster!	John Whorfin will kill us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But John Whorfin said kill her.	Damn John Whorfin--!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.	Why me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pick those up, Reno.	I didn't drop 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.	Where do you hail from, Doc?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any sign of Buckaroo?	No!  Ditto the professor-
<EOC>	<EOC>
So where's Buckaroo?	Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is, uh... Is he okay?	He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.	Please, Barton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see.	...I know this must look... funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you could, I'd 	If I can. He gets jealous; he-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.	Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I'm afraid I have.	What are they like? What are they about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...This'll sometimes help.	That doesn't help anything, Bill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-	Drown all those rascals...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How d'ya like your room!	...Who is this?
Chet!	...Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Hello.	Garland, it's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I write.	Oh yeah? What kind of write?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 	What DID you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long you been up there, Fink?	A week, eight, nine days 
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ever talk to him?	...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, he's funny that way.	I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.	So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well that's what he said.	What else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I beg your pardon?	W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?	It's still a little early for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!	I need help, Audrey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sound a little what?	Well, you just... sound a little
<EOC>	<EOC>
...This must be boring you.	Not at all. It's damned interesting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Your room does that too?	I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Can I come in?	No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Are you sure 	No... no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barton. Are you all right?	No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-	Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Will you stay with me till they get here?	Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus... They can tell that...	They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?	She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus... You're leaving.	Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be back?	Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But Charlie  why me? Why 	Because you DON'T LISTEN!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?	...Both maybe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...	Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I  Mr. Lipnik 	KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fink.	Mr. Lipnik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?	Must be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Okay	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okey-dokey, go ahead.	What 
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Those your only bags?	The others are being sent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
L.A.P.D.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this multiple choice?	Nine days  Tuesday 
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.	That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!	You're a sick fuck, Fink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got a couple questions to ask ya.	What do you do, Fink?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Big fuckin' deal.	You want my partner to kiss your ass?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.	His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.	He's a little funny in the head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.	No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I thought you said you were a writer.	I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Second one of your friends to end up dead.	You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?	Give you nose bleeds?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He teach you to do it?	You two have some sick sex thing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?	...Fred...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.	How's about it, Bart?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you tonight?	Home. Watching TV.
All night?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I was drinking.	When did you start drinking again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?	Bring 1976 up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So -- how are things?	Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was she like?	Who?
Catherine Tramell.	She said what you said she'd say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We were in some of the same classes.	Why didn't you tell me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need a cigarette.	I thought you quit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?	No, Nick, please --
Who?	Nilsen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want, Nick?	Tell me about Catherine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She told you, didn't she?	What did she tell me, Beth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should do something about this lock.	She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	Put your hands up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm De...	I know who you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long were you dating him?	I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you always keep old newspapers around?	Only when they make interesting reading.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a cigarette?	I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.	I quit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you -- I quit.	It won't last.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your new book about?	A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I miss something?	I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.	I have nothing to hide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you feel when he died?	I loved him.  I hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm tired.	It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I passed.	You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I... disturbing you?	No.  Come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.	I'd like to ask you some, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You tell me.	I don't know.  But you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.	There's a name from the past.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.	Fine.
Ice?	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you pay Nilsen?	Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Say -- ""What do you want from me, Catherine?"""	What do you want from me, Catherine?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you going to thank me?	What's it about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why does he do it?	To see if he can get away with it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your new book?	I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.	She's seen everything before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you think?	I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your shoulder?	Fine.  How's your back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shouldn't play this game.	I don't have a choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in over your head.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's OK.  It's OK.	Make love to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.	I never have before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You won't believe me.	Try me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you believe me?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You still think I kill people, don't you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I finished my book.	How did it end?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did he die?	He was murdered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have the right to an attorney.	Why would I need an attorney?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You workin' on another book?	Yes I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.	Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of drugs?	Cocaine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd it go, son?	She misses me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's goin' down, son?	Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think I --	I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.	I went over last night, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feeling better?	I feel fine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell you goin'?	I'm going with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe the maid did it.	She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look like dogshit.	He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Homicide.	What do you want?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?	Is he dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you with him last night?	You're looking for Catherine, not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you kidding me?	Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do we do -- nothing?	We bring her in for questioning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure?	I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you, Phil.	Fuck you, too Nick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's a suspect.	On what basis?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you think he's dead?	You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No Lisa Anderson, detective.	Can there be some mistake?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He died -- about five or six years ago.	He was shot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey  it's the big A.M..	Rene's been telling me about your work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this finished yet?	I don't know.
When's your show?	Not sure. How was yours?

Saddle River, New York!	It's in New Jersey.
New York.	I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.	Oh, I didn't know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was my favorite part!	We can do better. It needed more white.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	Annina Nosei.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Jean Michel here?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These are great.	Aren't they?
How much for these five?	You should talk to him about this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	You haven't been by lately.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	How about right now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.	Really?
Yeah.	Very well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paint it out.	Out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Andy again.	Still not here.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to put it here?	Use your fucking instinct.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blue? Where?	What's wrong with you today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey  Willie Mays.	Willie Mays.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're shattering all my myths.	About what?
Your people.	Oh  you mean black people!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Check you later, man.	Hi Gina.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
We got beat.	For real?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gonna carry that around all night?	Yeah... I'll paint on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the rush, John Henry?	I ain't John Henry.
Good.	What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's good.	I guess it was a long time ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You do! You definitely do.	Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.	Party girls? Can I call you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... I'll buy you some new ones.	You don't have any fucking money..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what he's saying?	What who's saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.	You want some?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.	Well thanks!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks done.	Think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>

What's wrong with me?	You're your own baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
What's that?	A present I picked up for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is amazing. What year is it?	George?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that the best quality you have?	Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.	It's three thousand dollars!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name, man?	They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you later.	Thanks
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can I ever thank you?	I'd like to squeeze your titties.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That one's for you.	Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?	A what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Phillips head,' right?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't have any!!!	That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's cold.	It's vichyssoise, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose you feel better now, sir.	No, actually I feel worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess this mean we won.	Yes, I suppose that we did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the fire?	"""Shreck's.""  You --"
<EOC>	<EOC>
How could you?  I'm a woman...	I'm -- sorry, I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.	We do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've met.	Have we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.	You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?	Yes and no ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pouring myself into my work.	I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Y'mean frame him?	You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son!	Dad!  Save yourself!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten, nine...	The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
... eight, seven...	Silent night, violent night...
<EOC>	<EOC>
"What, is that supposed to ""hypnotize"" me?"	No, just give you a splitting headache.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You certainly will not.	Oh no, those things frighten me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uncle Alfred?	In spirit only, I'm afraid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.	There's a lovely inn just down --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-	Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please be looking for me.	I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.	Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is easy.	Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crimefighter's rule number two.	I'm afraid to ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pow!  What!  Kazow!	What exactly are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice suit.  And today you are?	Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?	It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch the first step.	Surf's up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think Freeze will take the bait?	He'll be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.	I can make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you...?	Open Sesame...Chicken.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No beauty...	Just the beast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gotta get those locks changed.	She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.	Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No sign of the snowman.	Maybe he melted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If we could relay the sunlight-	From the other side of the equator-
<EOC>	<EOC>
And?	Can I get some help over here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not even listening to me.	What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's Ivy?	What?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?	I wish I knew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.	Well...um...her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to his wife?	Presumed dead.  No one knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-	At you?  Polly want a kiss?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The dreams again, sir?	I think they're getting worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe they're right.	Which `they' might that be, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Master, Bruce?	...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Letters in the alphabet.	Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.	Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?	Enigma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.	How ya doin', Al?
Al?	Big house. How many rooms?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up here, Al.	Just checking, young sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's home. I sent the signal.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now black rubber.	Try a fireman. Less to take off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't had much luck with women...	Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help Chase. I'll be back.	Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So glad you could come.	What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Psychiatrists make you nervous?	Just ones this beautiful.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?	On occasion. Usually at night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.	I'm sorry. Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like normal folks.	What? This isn't normal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you do that?	What?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...	I'm not-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. I'm outta here.	Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Edward...	Who is it?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?	How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.	Yesssssss. I know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is The Batman, Edward?	Can't tell if you don't say please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll show you it works.	What the hell is going on here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...or death.	Please. I swear I won't say noth-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait! You said you'd let me go!	Never heard of a double-cross?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you sending Batboy this time?	Here. Get a good seat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.	About what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead. You can say it.	You're a genius.

A-14.	Miss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
B-12.	A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A hit.	You sunk my battleship.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.	... Very good, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
GET IN THE CAR!!	WHICH CAR?

<EOC>	<EOC>
...Not even a 'thank you'?	Well -- I think you might consider
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please.	I won't let you have it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Vicki.	... Where are you taking me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... How long have I been out?	Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this stuff? Kevlar?	Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.	That's why I wear a target on my chest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want a drink?	Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All street mimes should be executed.	... Looks like a convention.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep her on the line!	... Where are you calling from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it!	What now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got 'em!	Take 'em! I want his head!
<EOC>	<EOC>
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!	WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --	WHAT??
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boss! Jesus! They've --	They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
<EOC>	<EOC>
MOVE! Can't you do something??	It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I missed you, Lieutenant.	Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I understand.	Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Thank you.	Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What am I injecting you with?	Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's dark in here.	You get used to the darkness.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just get out of here.	Blade --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he sick?	Cancer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.	You make it sound like I'm already dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It won't work on you.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here --	I'm not leaving without you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going, Kam?	You're a week early.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.	I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.	There's only one alternative to the serum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you -- died --	Deacon brought me back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't human blood.	Then what is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't started in on the internal organs?	Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's weird --	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We keep in radio contact.	You've been listening in the whole time?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whistler!	Go on, I'll be fine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?	We weren't sure we could trust you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you hunt them?	Habit, mostly, just like this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--and if she ever did--	--which she may have--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--or incredibly fucking naive.	Hey, folklore--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, are you alright?	My eye, is there something in my eye?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not that I can see.	Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Closer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??	I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--	--my God, Nick???
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.	Bullshit! Talk!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.	Sometimes. Where are we going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!	I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!	Let's talk to your husband--
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Shit? This is from ""Josh's Blair Witch Mix,"" man!"	Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""The Voiiiiices made him do it."""	The Witch's voice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, so?	So whoever built this--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Druid Hill Park.	That's a joke?
<EOC>	<EOC>
--the witch kills children--	I haven't killed any--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--	--Nick!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cheery little place.	It's like traveling back in time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Whatzername--the ""psychic"" Anna hired."	Domini. Domini Von Teer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	"You said the name ""James."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baby names?	I don't know. Nightmare.
You want me to scooch over next to you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--or someone--	--scared the living shit out of us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we get the gist.	We've looked at half of one tape.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--now c'mon!	Get your goddamn--
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--	--Cotter's--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can I get you?	Sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing. I dunno--	--you should get back into bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you marked like this??	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?	Yeah.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?	The, uh, blur there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a hand?	I want amphetamines.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beer and weed is what I've got.	Both. Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!	Sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--	--no, I think they're all in there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--	--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is a little nuts.	Turn the tapes back on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it hurt?	Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There, what? I didn't see anything.	Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The witch?	It's not about witches, goddamnit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?	Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe this.	I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice tent.	Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Never would've guessed.	So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.	I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What movies?	Ask me what I don't have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should be so lucky.	Butt-ugly owl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you, crazy??	What're you, nuts?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get <u>out</u> of here!	What're you doing with all this shit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
--yeah, a hand or something--	--coming out of the water--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about night?	Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get inside quick, they'll stop.	Too busy eating us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mi casa y su casa!	Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?	Still don't see it--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Domini?	My room, asleep, last I checked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fire escape??	Don't have one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy Kurth.	Heather, does that look like Domini there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	Down there in the Park.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.	How's she going to know where to--
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's <u>freezing</u>.	Next time try putting on shoes--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck--??	--I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be it still alive, James?	<u>What</u>--
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd strongly advise you to join us--	--before you lose your emotional lunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"That's a ""j."""	"For ""James?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	No one ever comes here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold this.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
--Cotter--	--a Wiccan--
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not making Blair Witch II here.	I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cotter?	I'm not finished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing?	This isn't about us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Look over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, but--	--now there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get inside.	First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?	All I need--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Running a junk yard.	A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What--	--oh, Jesus--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--whatever you want, no problem--	--still go see the OB in the morning--
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?	Enough to keep sane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?	I think it's time to get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just hold on!	I can't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just let it go, I've got you!	What're you nuts--
--it's less than four feet, just--	--shit!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	One of the printers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.	Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She got <u>paid</u>.	I thought the movie was bitchin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.	Ancient runes--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.	Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oooh. Oooh.	Ah, Domini?
What?	You planning on sleeping out there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.	Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pointless.	No. I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Why she kills children.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone want to tell me what's going on--	--and we brought it back with us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Women miscarry all the--	--no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you see?	Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For a blur?	There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cotter'll kill you.	He'll never know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad...?	What'd you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	....I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	It touched me, don't you see it now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you afraid's going to happen?	That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--bullshit--	--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
<EOC>	<EOC>
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.	Whatever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Domini's the only logical explanation.	We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't do it!	Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Gothic rune--the letter ""S."""	Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should check on Anna.	Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
"She's far from ""fine."""	You're needed here--keep watching--
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. We <u>all</u> go.	Anna--
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""It's why the witch kills children."""	I thought all witches were benign and good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
....Ma'am?	I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--yes--	--the Sheriff's Office--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--	--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.	I am?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I could've sworn I heard something.	Door's locked. Nothing there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Well I'll be damned.	I couldn't believe it either...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.	Thanks.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.	...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.	...You ever get tired?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?	I don't know. It's early... I love you.

<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
...But first I gotta know what happened.	What do you want to know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...So?	I think someone's watching.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how long have you know Meurice?	About ten years.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Then what'd you come here for?	You owe me for two weeks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you take these for?	What do you mean...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now that don't make much sense.	No. It just made them feel better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to kill 'em.	I didn't say that.  Well?
Well what?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. Is it...	Ya catch any fish?
...What?	Ya catch any fish?

Dead, huh?	So it would seem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Count it if you want.	Nah, I trust ya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.	Has Ray come in yet?

<EOC>	<EOC>
George.	Tuna.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hello.
Do I know you?	I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?	Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.	I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, George.  You okay?	Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mirtha, how are you doing?	Better than you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.	What's happening to us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Are we gonna split up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?	I'll be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.	It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...	I know, Dad.  I know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.	Yes, I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not enough.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So?	So, we need to get to the source.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit, Dulli!	Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No shit, Kevin?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.	Don't be such a pussy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.	And here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
With an unloaded pistol?	I'll explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And how many are we?	Not enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you read?	Sure ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Read it.	Here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's good nobody is following us ...	It's a question of habit ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think of the strike, Ali?	I think it'll be a success ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were we?	Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.	Good evening, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...	A name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is she saying?	She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is speaking?	Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready, colonel?	Yes ... But let me first see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doin' Mister D?	Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been waiting for you to get back.	You got something on the coke?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take some time off.	You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did a good job, Charlie.	Thanks, Mister D.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I'm going to make your day.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Then you can go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About three hours.	Cause?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?	No -- never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No questions.	You may call your next witness.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Objection, Your Honor.	Counsel approach the bench.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's innocent.	Aren't they all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got work to do.	Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I go?	You get his statement?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?	I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?	No.  I haven't done it in years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her name?	Rebecca Lawson.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?	No -- but I can get it for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it Marsh?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.	Thank you.  The State rests.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.	No further questions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?	No.
High school?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.  I'm not sure.	Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who told you that?	He video taped you.
That bastard!	I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank!	I'll have you out in a few hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we get out of here?	Sure.  Where to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your house.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.	Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.	It's not my taste.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes -- it would be nice.	What would?
You and me -- making love.	Is that what you think I was thinking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?	I went out on the boat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alone?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were brilliant today.	It's only the beginning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I see you later?	You can see me now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something wrong?	Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sugar or honey?	Honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rebecca -- take these off.	Tonight we open new doors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going you doing?	Are you scared?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm dropping the case.	No -- you're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, I'll talk to her	She's waiting in the conference room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you.	I love you too, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But Your Honor--	That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The witness will answer the question.	Mr. Roston?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't it wait?	No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She sounds like quite a woman.	Yeah -- but can she cook?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Humped	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah -- what are you doing up?	We have to talk.
What's wrong?	That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	Talk to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!	Daddy -- stop it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	What time did you leave?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did Marsh use it?	No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.	It didn't get there from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a beautiful picture of her.	Why are there two deeds here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eeeww!	I know. I don't understand it either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How bizarre!	Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.	No treasure maps, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?	No. You can have them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?	He's not coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought everything WAS arranged.	Well, there's a problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Michael.
What?!	Come here a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?	No, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's changed.	Oh, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"My niece had ""the changes"" when she was thirty-one."	No. What a tragedy. What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"What do you know about ""the changes""?"	Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty country.	Hmm-mmm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh there you are.	Oh! You caught me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, that's nice.	Want another cigarette?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.	Francesca.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemon?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I smoke?	Not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feeling better?	Much.
Is the dizziness gone?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.	It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?	We got engaged.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smells like dirt.	You get used to it.
When?	You want to go back in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	I want you to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to eat something?	Are you hungry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I'm sorry.	It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you don't mind.	No, I don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What were you like when you were younger?	Trouble. Why?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?	I had a temper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't do this, honey.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feeling better Franny?	Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm positive.	I'm going to miss you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Franny?	Hmm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you seeing Betty tonight?	Nah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	What's her name?
Betty.	What's she like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God...!	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
About an hour ago.	They're not going to find her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did she decide this?	Apparently just before her death.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't feed that dog.	You people really don't like dogs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, kid.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think that's really him?	Damn.  It's so...fresh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.	I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	Spooked?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.	Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the others?	Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the gangsta of love?	Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can climb out.	Climb out to where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this Hell?	Or just Hell-adjacent...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a nice crib here.	I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you to do something for me, baby.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we, baby?	Where we'll always be...
But.	Hush, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?	We met.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, my brother.	Since we was just grasshoppers...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What it will be.	How did you get in here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cinn?	What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm here.	Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...	Okay, okay.  Listen:
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gotta jump!	I can't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're here.  Where the hell are you?	Back here.  At the end of the block.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got the cash?	You got the shit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we doing down here?	Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...help me...	Dad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell do you want?	Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice rack.  How old is --	That's it.  Get out.  Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.	Now you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Illibent?  Who's club is that?	Ours!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shouldn't have hit me.	You want to get into this now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Glenlivet, right, Gino?	I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So Caesar, what did it total out at?	Two point one seventy-six.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.	Know what?
Open the case!	All right!  Where's the key?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How the fuck can I open it?	The same way you did before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The next one blows off your dick.	You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We know how this was done, eh?	Yeah, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Caesar?  What is this?	Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit down, Gino!	No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're family, Caesar.	No!
Gimme the gun.	I can't.  I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't expect --	What the fuck is going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, shit ...	Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, you just got out?	Jesus, Caesar!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not bad.  What for?	That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Caesar, what happened?	It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?	Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry, I'll get some more.	There's no time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They were early.	What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?	What are you, drunk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean they weren't up here?	No!  They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell them!  Tell them!	For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck.	Caesar, what are we going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!	Caesar, someone could see us out here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not here, Caesar.	Where, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	We're going to need some time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is the money?	Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!	He can't kill you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Violet!	Not until he has the money!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stupid cunt!	Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.	You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, Violet.	Let us go and we'll make a deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did she do to you?	Everything you couldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We were in a car accident --	They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.	They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now that's teamwork.	I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.	I knew I couldn't trust you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going tonight, fellas?	Pretty good, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not on duty, sorry.	Oh, right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?	Where's the fucking money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're helping Rajeev?	No.  Rajeev's in India.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many'd you do?	Five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't kill me yet.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?	Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Hey, Mickey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We was worried about you, Cease.	Me?  Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cease, can I ask you something?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that the money?	Yeah, that's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Gino!  It's Gino!	Where in the hell is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.	Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got the key?	Oh yeah.  Violet!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me as soon as you get him.	Leave your phone on the hook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	This is the police, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.	How do I know you are cops?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ma'am, you have to open the door.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See?  We're for real.	I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is a beautiful place.	...  thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So this is temporary for you?	Pretty much.  One day at a time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guessed you were straight black.	Good guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Truck.	Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.	I knew it.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?	I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a pot or a bucket?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, one drink.	What do you want?
A beer?	A beer.  Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you surprised that I know what it is?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...  I needed that.	Tell me about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.	I think so, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said he washed the money?	Yeah.
Then what?  Exactly.	He hung it up.
What?	To let it dry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And where is it now?	In his office.  I saw it this morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's in a case, on his desk.	Does the case lock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where will you be?	Waiting in the apartment next door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if he sees you?	He won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm just asking, what if?	If he does ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had a partner and she fucked me.	I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's me.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Corky ...	Don't be sorry.  Help me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey.
How'd it go?	I'm here, aren't I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.	Pop?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?	Hey, Johnnie ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, God.	Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!	Violet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paris.  I live in Paris...	...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Yes.	...it's a problem...

So what's in Paris?	I want to go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever think maybe you have a family?	I thought about it.  I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...	That's it?  Is that it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four-fifty.  That's the address...	Looks familiar?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So this is it, right?	I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should go.	I don't remember any of this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, so...	Thanks for the ride.

Hello, Jack!	You remember Alison?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.	Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack!!	SAM! What a surprise!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack?... Jack?	Shut up!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.	Bastard!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stupid bastard!	What?
How could you do this to me?	Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!	Jack ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	It's you ... it's you ...

She's dancing with me.	Crash, I didn't think you--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn.	You're pulling your hips out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn.	Let me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crash...I want you.	Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
He' s confused--	Aren't we all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got released.	I heard already.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ninety-five miles an hour.	He looks great, just great!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.	What's it say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh dear....easy honey...	Ninety-five miles an hour...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ninety-three miles an hour.	He looks wonderful, Jackson...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ebby's told me a lot about you.	Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
<EOC>	<EOC>
God bless you.	She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.	You need a nickname.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.	The socks?  It's cold in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?	Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.	Never heard of 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.	C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got him on the knee!	You missed him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.	Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?	I won't have to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Party without me.	God--what a Big League move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."""	Yep.  So how's Annie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	I'm nervous--my old man's here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to the Show.	Then go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm trying to thank you.	Let go of me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.	Yeah, thanks for everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nuke--  Good luck.	You too...Meat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.	What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?	Crash, shut the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Step outside, pal.	Love to--
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe in fighting.	Pussy.
Take the first shot at me.	I ain't hitting a man first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Who you calling a ""boy""?"	See ya at the yard, Meat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?	Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
No.	Can I give you my testimony?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well tell 'em, honey.	We're getting married.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Little high.	C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...	...and one helluva guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's going on out there?	It's a damn convention.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'you want, kid?	Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?	Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.	I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	...he did what he was told.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Ace.	Hello, Senator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.	Good to see ya.  William would you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...stupid things.	Watch it, partner, watch it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Randy. Thank you.	All right, take care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop -	Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!	Hold on a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	You fuckin' piece of shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?	Hey, little Dale Evans.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Have a good day at school.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello? Hello! Ginger.	Help, Daddy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Amy! Amy, open the door!	I can't! I'm tied!
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did this happen, honey?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take Columbia for twenty.	If his girlfriend was knocked up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Sammy.	Somethin', huh?
Yeah.	Ginger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?	Honey, come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohh!	And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Listen...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Ace.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.	I see you, you motherfuckers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?	No, a...
...hundred yards further down the road.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?	It's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?	No, I'm not okay.
How'd you know I was here?	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.	How do you do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, it is my pleasure.	Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You go and put your things away.	And they were usually right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?	Yeah, refill'd be great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!	I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.	What can I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need this guy.	We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.	I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.	Call security.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To Abraham Lincoln.	L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sam, we got a problem.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, he's really pissed.	Oh, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.	Who's this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. Just take it easy.	Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to go powder my nose.	Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.	See you, Ginger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She took care of the dealers...	Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	Yeah.
Why're you crying?	I'm not crying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to go? Let's go back in.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding? My God. What is it?	It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.	It's nice isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.	Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what'd ya do with it?	With what?
With the money.	He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.	He wanted a watch, too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.	Mm-hm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're lower than a dog!	Fuck you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!	Get out of here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are not threatening me anymore!	I'm not -
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid to let her in the house.	Oh, you are...
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.	Let me in the house! Fucker!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It won't happen again, Sam.	Mr Rothstein.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no? You didn't?	I didn't give 'em the m-
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to go to Europe.	Shut your mouth!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know where she gets this from!	You shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!	He won't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fucker!	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I go in?	That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Can I go in?	Jeff, would you go in with her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	Hey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. I'm sorry.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.	She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you! Fuck you!	Yeah?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!	Now move along.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave me alone!	Here we go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.	Is that the last one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's comin' over.	Great!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.	We're waiting on Carmine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carmine left?	He's gone?
He's not here?	Carmine's gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I'm over here with him.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Artie!	Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!	Stay out of the way!
Artie! Artie!	We can't help him if -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Frankie.	How are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a round figure on it?	Definitely the most important guy in this room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.	That's enough now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Jennifer.	Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?	Okay, Sammy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	It's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!	All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!	Okay, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?	I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...same outfit.	But I saw something...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes!	Thank you. Very nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!	Get lost?
Yes.	Get lost?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, how 'bout that?	Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't make me come there. Answer me.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?	Promise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...all the luck in the world.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.	Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.	They check in alone?
They checked in alone.	Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, how you doin'?	Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow.	Boy, look at this place, huh?
Incredible.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?	Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm-hm.	You know why, right?
Yeah.	Why?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.	What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.	Hold it, hold it. Here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ace saw Vegas one way.	You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smarten up.	You jag-off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You walk past me?	Hey. This is Shelly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And this is Stacy.	Stacy.
This is Nick.	Pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine. Everything's goin' good.	...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, thanks a lot.	But he never talked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm.	Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
They're havin' a good time too.	So are we.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sue me, you Jew fuck!	Let's get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must have drunk too much.	Go fuck yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't know.	Dominick said they're in the motel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calm down, calm down. Shh!	Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frankie!	No more! You see? Watch!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!	Fuck you, you motherfuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No more fuckin' dirty work!	No, no, no, no!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My fuckin' head.	Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.	Then do it the way you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Having a good time?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The crowd bought it.	Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.	Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hmm. Not bad.	You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Women, huh?	They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.	She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?	She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding.	But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Dat's gotta hurt!"""	He didn't remember to roll up his window...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, this is better than rape.	Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"What a ""drag."""	"""Well done,"" Cactus."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...	Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Car wash, Captain?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.	Now he'll be up all night...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I loved you.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spooky.	Spear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a good mother!	"You mean, ""Consuela"" is a good mother.."
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!	What's the name of your child's best friend?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late.	Yes, Mother. Dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice breasts.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was someone in an accident?	Do I hear a woman's voice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.	That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's on the phone?	I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you two cut it out?	This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?	Why would I do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's have your license, mister.	I'm going to level with you officer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you said you could handle him.	I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.	What am I supposed to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lose the hardware now.	We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.	Allow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you please speak to me! Theo?	Another minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you do for a living?	Sometimes I paint.
Our house always needs touching up.	Pictures.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.	They say my work is somewhat derivative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.	I can hear you again, clearly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?	That's not her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does she wear glasses?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rachel -- Oh my God.	Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's locked.	Shit.  I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's in back?	L.A.P.D.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think they'll walk away?	Ask them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.	That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.	Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Know what else is in here?	Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.	Who is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop the crying.	She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Count it.	Don't worry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seems like it.	Put the girl on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he doing?  Answer me!	Better reassure him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.	Stay put!  I know my way around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I already called for an ambulance.	You've got a <u>phone</u>?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I make a quick call?	Government business?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scottish?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So can we consider you a regular, sir?	Is that good or bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So let's call this the usual.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It takes all types.	So who's he?
He's what she should run a mile from.	Then why doesn't she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See that, Col?	See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.	Did he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just cut his hair, you know.	Yeah?
What you think?	Nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Saw that one.	What would you call it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He agreed that he was.	What do you think his name is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what he said. Jimmy.	Hi, Jimmy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's still looking, Col.	Persistent.
Good thing in a man.	An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.	I would expect he does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ask him.	Ask him yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see that, Col?	Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.	Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck off, Dave.	C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fucking promised.	Did I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be like that --	You heard me --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.	It's him, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See, they get the wrong idea.	Cunt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.	Charming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --	It's Dave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure, Dave --	Please, Dil --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take your clothes.	Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!	Fucking mad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't chuck my clothes out!	Take your fucking goldfish, too!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you mean that?	He wants to know do I mean that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?	She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.	She's not that either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do it on your own time, Paddy.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that supposed to mean?	It's a simple question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?	Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.	Bloody right I do...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone recommend you?	In a way.
Who?	Guy I work with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doesn't the water get to your nails?	What's it to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You American?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Scottish?
How'd you guess?	The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?	Like treacle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That should make her happy.	Who's she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell her I'm very happy with it.	He's Scottish, Col.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jimmy.	Jimmy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everybody wants something.	Not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You old-fashioned?	Must be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi. You forgot your bag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	They all get the wrong idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?	He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?	You know.
You on the game?	God no. I'm a hairdresser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's getting up.	You can't leave me then, can you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to ask you in, right?	No, I didn't --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me that look again.	What look?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that about?	They're jealous.
Why?	I wonder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a special friend, Jimmy?	How special?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ!	Jesus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That Dave?	The things a girl has to put up with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like a drink?	Yes, please.
What'll it be?	Whiskey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone out there.	Jesus fucking Christ.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He lived here with you?	Tried to. Sit down, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was different.	How different?
As different as it's possible to be.	Tell me about him.
No.	Shouldn't I go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No --	Did you do that to him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to know how I kissed him?	Yes...
Are you jealous of him?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you miss him?	What do you think?
I think you do.	You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?	Like you're concerned.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you can t stay, you know that?	Didn't think I could.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't you be in mourning?	I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did he come here too?	Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.	He did sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?	Want to look after you.
What does that mean?	Something I heard someone say once.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean that?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drink.	What is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't leave me now.	Aha.
The thing is, can you go the distance?	Depends what it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you thinking of, hon?	I'm thinking of your man.
Why?	I'm wondering why you keep his things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?	All the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Even now.	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --	Dil --
Tell him it hurt --	I have to talk to her, Col --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Dil --	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're something else, Dil, you know that?	Never said a truer word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could?	Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.	You mean that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.	Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.	I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.	You think that's wise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't mean to hit you.	I know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kind of liked you as a girl.	That's a start.
So I'm sorry.	Make it up to me, then.
How?	Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?	When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Details, baby, details.	So they do know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.	Sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?	Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.	You can always pretend.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?	Absolutely.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?	Are you pretending yet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's Dave. He knew too.	Stop it, Jimmy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I becoming repetitious?	A little.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ask me in.	Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.	I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.	Don't be cruel.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.	Only if you kiss me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy now?	Delirious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.	Not at all, honey.
Don't.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.	Why, honey --
Come on.	You gonna tell me why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --	Not here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dil, this is Jude.	You following me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's her, isn't it?	What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.	Kind of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't be, Dil	Why shouldn't I be jealous?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She own you, Jimmy?	Yes.
She from Scotland too?	You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you doing, Jimmy?	I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?	More than that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You do something for me, Dil?	Anything.
You'd do anything for me?	Afraid so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want another haircut, baby?	No. Sit down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said anything, Dil	A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?	Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?	No.
You promise?	I promise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're no good at this, Jimmy.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So it's true, then?	What?
You like me better like this.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't call me that --	Sorry. What you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	For me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are we going here, Jimmy?	Look on it like a honeymoon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on...	No! I'm going home...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So tell me.	I was trying to get out of something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.	You mean that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You heard what I said, Dil?	My pills...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What pills?	Prescription. For my condition.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you supposed to take that many?	Only in times of extreme stress.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right, Dil?	I will be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-bye, Dil	Jimmy?
What?	Don't go like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You killed my Jody?	In a manner of speaking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You killed my Jody	No.
You didn't.	I suppose I tried.
You tried.	Don't you want to kill me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Got to be somewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like me now, Jimmy?	I like you, Dil --
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.	More what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
More endearments.	I like you, DIl
Love me.	Yes.
Tell me you love me.	Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.	Love you, Dil.
You do?	Yeah.
What would you do for me?	Anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say it again.	I'd do anything for you, Dil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you'll never leave me?	Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that she called you, Jimmy?	Fergus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's Fergus?	It's my name, Dil --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to go now, Dil --	Do I?
Yes. Now.	Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.	Will I see you again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise?	I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?	The Metro.
Meet Col --	Yes. Say hello to Col --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lucky you.	Carnations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was it?	You know her, Jimmy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go looking for it, Dil.	Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?	A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fergus!	You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.	That's wise, Tommy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you need, Fergus?	Need to go across the water.
Do you now.	Need to lose myself awhile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See does he want some.	Do you want some food?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know that.	Fucking do. I had him all over me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tough work, that.	Someone's got to do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave us, Judie.	My pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.	He's hot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But, then, I don't have a choice.	Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.	Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And then you'll leave her out of it?	Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what if I say no?	You know what. Go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jude?	Yes?
Who's the old geezer?	Some judge...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You a handyman, Fergie?	I take pride in my work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dil!	Get that thing off me, Fergus --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give him a cup of tea.	Do you want a cup of tea?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So he knows your name?	I told him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You OK about that?	I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want to do that for?	Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?	I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So it was you all the time.	Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.	And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.	Should blow you away, you know that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?	A hotel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eat something, would you?	Can't.
What do you mean you can't?	Can't eat through a canvas bag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, handsome.	My pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you know it was her?	I can smell her perfume.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.	Can't we take it off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?	Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?	No. It's the truth.
Well, I could say the same about you.	Could you?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.	So I've noticed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey --	What is it now?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?	Do what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't look like that to me...	She's not my type.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mere.	No.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She'd be anyone's type.	Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?	She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
No?	Absolutely not.
She your wife?	Suppose you could say that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to meet you, Fergus.	My pleasure, Jody
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, that was worth waiting for.	Hurry up, would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now put it back in.	Give us a break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fergus?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See? I was right about you.	Don't be so sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where would you most like to be now, man?	Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.	Having a pint in the Rock.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.	Like what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See if she's all right.	I don't know her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me.	How can I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing.	Tell me something, anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?	Me? No, I'm not good for much...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take the hood off, Fergus --	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stupid bastard --	What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --	Got to catch me first --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't run off, Jude.	You don't know me, do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if I did?	You'd know I wouldn't run off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.	You didn't?
And you know what?	Tell me, Jody
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not here.	Who gives a fuck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never know nothing.	People. They could be looking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come and get me, soldier --	Whatever you say, Jude...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you no feelings, woman?	You shut your face --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --	He's a good soldier, Jude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said shut the fuck up --	He believes in the future --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.	Shut the fuck up, Jude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.	That true, Fergus? You in love?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That fucker's dead --	No, we are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me the shooter, Jude --	You're crazy --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you should see your face.	What about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam!	It's all right -- look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When you come on, you really come on.	Well -- come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Open up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reggie -- why won't you listen?	I'm through listening to you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I didn't kill anybody.	Then who did? You're the only one left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reggie -- please believe me!	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reggie -- listen to me!	You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.	Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't have to chase me so hard --	Here, give it to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure there's no mistake?	None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Charles!	Very good.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?	1944. The next face, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?	We wait -- with our mouths shut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long do you intend -- ?	I said with the mouth shut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry about that.	Okay -- up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I knock or something?	Open it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep going.	The view had better be worth it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back where?	That's the idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.	I'll take that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it hurt?	Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.	Okay.
What are you doing?	Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?	You did.
But I'm not through complaining yet.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.	I think I love you, Alex --
<EOC>	<EOC>
They've got Jean-Louis!	That sounds like their problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.	I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?	Maybe.
Or Tex?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd love some, thanks.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.	How often do you go through this little ritual?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.	I don't believe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?	And if it is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean, no?	The kid said --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.	But his mother --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You loved him?	I'm very cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was American?	Swiss.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?	He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?	I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?	I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?	I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?	I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!	I know.  I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it all right?	I wish you wouldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course it is.	And this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't understand.	And this? And this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up there! It is up there!	No, Jean-Louis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.	The man and the woman are married --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was all that?	Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?	No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
<EOC>	<EOC>
En garde.	Lay on, MacDuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing in here?	Having a nervous breakdown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're here.	Where?
On the street where you live.	How about once more around the park?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	The man you had the fight with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes -- that's right.	What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howdy, Miz Lampert.	Wha -- what do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...	No -- no, I'm don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop that!	Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
<EOC>	<EOC>
But why do you want a divorce?	Because I don't love him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He knows everything.	Don't you want me to stay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know him?	I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.	How can you tell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it from?	The American Embassy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't see him.	We will separate -- you look over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howdy, Miz Lampert.	Who invited you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.	We want that money -- now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
One more time.	I get the imports.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Jody.	I just wanted to check that you were okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi honey.	Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi honey.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ok.	Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
No honey.	You are upset.
I'm not.	I thought you'd be pleased.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was a she.	Are you sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	Run!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Jody still awake?	She just turned off her light.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	This will relax her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She's not here.	You know where I can find her?
St. Michael's.	She works at a church?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of what?	A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She was murdered?	No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pay no attention to me.	What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fucked me up!	What?
You gave me a 'D'.	I'm sure you should have failed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You aren't going to the party?	You know about that too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you know about my father?	He's a rapist. Like mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?	You think you're my sister?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I promised I'd go right home after school.	OK. increase the peace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ok?	FINE. Are you?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?	What?
Mark invited me to the party.	What party?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?	Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for coming back for me.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Pretend we're just another couple.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi mom.	Hi princess.
Mom?	Yes?
I need to ask you something.	You can ask me anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	The library. I'll be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Sisler was one of them.	The principal?
Yes.	Who was the fourth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Are you Jody?
<EOC>	<EOC>
On what side of the family?	His mother's side.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I got to go.
What?	I'm worried about someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.	Hi Sandy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can have both if you want.	No, you keep one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're so beautiful.	So are you.
Now don't be nervous.	You're the one who's hand is shaking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! That was a 3k machine.	Told you to hide it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said no.	But you don't really mean it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it won't stay in.	Maybe you better just drive me home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rod!	You're being unfair.
Unfair?!	Yes. Unfair to me.

Sir?	I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did she get that idea?	I think I gave it to her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.	What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?	Yes... I think I can manage...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does this mean?	That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They don't kill a guy for that.	Oh they don't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of guy do you think I am?	Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure thing.	Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.	Where's that?
Off the alley.	Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.	Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.	Tell her later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.	Okay.
That's a filthy habit.	I said okay, Jake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what'll you do?	Sue the shit out of 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	I've been wanting to meet you.
Why?	Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I'm not.	Well you own a lot of land.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's just lovely.	Thank you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, Lou.	How'd you get past the guards?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've done well by yourself.	I get by.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations.	Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.	Who?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?	Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.	You're welcome to try. There he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want it anymore.	No?
No. It was an accident.	You mean that's what you're going to call it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	Didn't you call?
How do you happen to know her?	I don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?	How did she...  ...happen to have them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	C'mon I'll show you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too late.	Too late for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know what he says.	Shut up.  Go on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it?	Yeah.
Well, let's go.	Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never learn, do you, Gittes?	I guess not.
Give you three minutes.	Gee, thanks, Lou.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Do you know where she might be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like something to drink?	What are you having?
Iced tea.	Yeah. Fine, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.	...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.	Oh... thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got your check in the mall.	Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?	I was grateful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unless what?	She's cheating on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like the word 'cheat.'	Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.	Did he know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there anything else you want to know?	Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.	You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.	You were seeing someone, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
K... Cross.	That your maiden name?
Yes... why?	No reason.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another satisfied client?	Another satisfied client's wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll stay.	Get in the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maid's night off?	Why?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.	I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.	No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was in Chinatown.	What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.	Doing what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
As little as possible.	The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get some sleep?	Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.	Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?	I want to see her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Going somewhere?	Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's good. Now what's her name?	Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?	She's my daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said the truth!	She's my sister.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said I want the truth.	She's my sister and my daughter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know?	He didn't wear bifocals.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me handle that.	I'm all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walsh here?	He's in the dark room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sophie.	Yes, Mr. Gittes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, Sophie.	A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?	Ida Sessions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my goodness.	Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a married man, am I right?	Yes...
Hard working, have a wife and kids...	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Gittes?	Yes?
Do you know me?	Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?	Well, no.
Never?	Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?	Si.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The water.	What about the water?
When it comes.	When it comes? What'd you tell him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Drowned, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's bone dry, Morty.	It's not completely dry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gittes?... Gittes?	Yeah.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?... I do?	Sure you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?	Mr. Gittes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, really?	I'm afraid so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, what's your husband's first name?	Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Mulwray, please.	He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.	May I ask what this is regarding?
It's personal. Has he been out long?	Since lunch.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.	He was expecting you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.	Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.	I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julian Cross worked for the water department?	Yes. No.
He did or he didn't?	He owned it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So he says you sent them?	They're all a bunch of phonies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not exactly.	But that's what you told your wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Course, she settled down nicely.	Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.	Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.	We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You understand which side the gelatin's on?	It tastes wonderful!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will they really find work in Germany?	Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?	Come in, Alfredo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!	Progress! It always arrives too late!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what can you see?	Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.	What's she like? What's she like?...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You weren't expecting me?	No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever see her again?	No. And nobody knows where she is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You understand now? You see it clearly?	Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name's Salvatore...And yours?	Elena. My name's Elena.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, I have sinned...	We'll talk about that later.
But...who...	Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't care. I'll wait.	For what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My husband...you know him.	Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -	How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He sure did, Mr. Kane.	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Kane -	That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three cents.	Two cents.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.	Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wasted?	Charlie?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sixty-two thousand -	That looks pretty nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you, Mr. Leland?	Certainly not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you, Mr. Leland?	Certainly not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Mr. Leland.	Hello, Bernstein.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!	We've got a nice plant here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What story, Mr. Rogers?	The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Brad -	Emily -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yes, there is.	I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -	Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -	I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out, both of you!	Charlie, please don't -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow!	What's the matter with you?
Toothache.	Hmm!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the soap?	In the water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won't let you go.	You can't stop me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You goin', Mom?	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get Dr. Corey.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Mrs. Kane -	Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Close the door, Raymond.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Raymond -	Yes, sir -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like poetry, Raymond?	Can't say, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Mr. Kane.	Not my wife - not either of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tired?	It's been a tough day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
First of all -	What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.	I'll get you some coffee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.	It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brief marriage!  Ten years!	Was he in love?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?	Right here, Mrs. Kane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -	This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.	Good!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the whole works, right up to date.	Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.	Well, thanks a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you meet him?	I had a toothache.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?	I'll have a highball.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure?	Am I sure?
Are you sure?	Am I sure about what?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?	Are you serious?
How long have you been smoking?	What is this, a poll?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus!	It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?	This? How long have you been smoking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks. Have a good one.	Do you mind if I drink this here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beats me.	How long have you been a smoker?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was here the whole time.	You two better quit it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody! I swear!	I feel nauseous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	No, don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you get back?	Just now.
My God. I haven't seen you since...	Dante. You've got a customer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you get here so fast?	I left like an hour ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm serious.	We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop this. This isn't funny.	I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!	I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe this! I feel faint...	Call the police.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you open?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you to make assessments?	I'll assess all I want!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like you're better!	I can whip your ass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you open?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?	Lenin's Tomb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?	Annoying Customer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pack of cigarettes.	What's your point?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cute cat. What's his name.	Peptic ulcer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You open?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You only brought one ball?!	I thought Redding had like three balls!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time do you have to stay till?	He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?	Go open the sore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why doesn't he just mix and match?	I told him that and he yelled at me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Design major.	Can we not talk about this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what Sanford told me?	I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.	Yeah, right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was pretty young, hunhh?	Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.	An embarrassing way to die.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.	How'd he die?
Broke his neck.	That's embarrassing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me borrow your car.	I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.	Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.	You want to rent a movie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that for?	You work in a video store!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?	Could be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just fucked a total stranger?	Shut the fuck up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Around three or something.	What time did we go to the funeral?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you open?	Yes.
Just the paper.	Thirty-fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.	I know I can bench more than that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's got those love handles.	I don't have love handles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know him?	Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am not.	How much can you bench?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are there any balls down there?!	'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What is that?	She called you, didn't she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You open?	Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you working here at about four o'clock?	I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not out of shape!	Can I have your name please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you go.	What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.	WHAT?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way!	Swear.  Olaf, metal!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he say?	I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That doesn't sound metal.	"You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, ""Berserker!"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Did he say ""making fuck?"""	Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You know how the airlines are.	Bags?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on, fetch.	I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you, Walker?	You're getting warmer!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!	If you want, do it.  I don't care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget me.  If you can, get away.	Would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.	My pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
There you go.	One...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two...	That's it, you look like a professional.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four...five...	Nice and easy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Use your other hand!  Grab it!	Help me!  I don't want to die!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?	Just hangin' out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's be creative.	Excuse me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.	What about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.	Call me sentimental.
Remember the first time we came up here?	Of course I do.
It was great.	You attacked me.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?	Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice view, huh?	Breathtaking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gabe!  Are you alright?	No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you see light?	Up ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No luck?	Next time, date only basketball players.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's a lyin' bitch!!	Get it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!	Jess, c'mon...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Reach up!  Do it!	Don't let me fall!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about you?!	RUN, DAMMIT!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the helicopter?	What the hell's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he doing?	The best he can since you gave him nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's up there, on the Tower.	How far?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said there was a way across.	There is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He never hurt anybody.	I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah...	Anyone else following?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your names?	Tucker and Walker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On top of the peak.	It looks like a winding route.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then where the fuck is!	There.  You blind?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go after her.	Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God!	Climb, Gabe, climb!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.	Then it's a deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the delay?	Let's move your ass in there!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!	Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!	The monitor! I never ask twice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't use my name!	Ask the questions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the third one, Travers?	There, what's that place?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't trust him.	Kill him when he gets down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!	We can't and he knows it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man against nature, right Travers.	What about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This way.	Then go fetch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's alive!	He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it set?	Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
<EOC>	<EOC>

What are you gonna do?	Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.	Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding me.	I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not paying you one cent!	Who the hell is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.	Jesus, what is with this guy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll keep calling.	Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Oh.  Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?	Yeah, yeah, sorry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have a deal.  What's your name?	Max.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.	You always stutter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"You cool, Max?  Say ""I'm cool."""	You're cool.
No.  You say you're cool.	I'm cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max.	It's not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You listening to me?	Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...	Two...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Try some deep breathing.	What?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you breathing?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Music.	Play music.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get rid of 'em.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.	Good luck.  You think they got families?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	Lenny, my dispatcher.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another collateral.	What?
Collateral damage.	I don't understand...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vincent?	Yes, Max?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	No.
What you mean, no?	I'm done.  Find another cab.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max?  What are you doing?	Leave me alone.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.	<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show up for what?	Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom, Vincent's not interested.	Oh, I'm captivated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You take one more step, I'll kill her.	You'd do her a favor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>	Jazz.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gimme your wallet.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well.  That was brilliant.	Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max?	Let her go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The sound of love.	Excuse me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never told her.	Why the hell not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you crazy?!	The guy came right at us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was only going one way.	Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --	Just drop me off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Saved you last night's, too.	Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I bit the bastard's nose off.	You bit someone's nose off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the charge?	You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just relax.	Switch the charts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
People do have heart attacks.	Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He says a dog bit his nose.	Arf... You gotta help me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it?	I have no idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Flesh wound.  No big deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want something to drink?	Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If my universe had a hub...	This would be it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Equitation.	I've been reading up on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Getting rid of my hub!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was that who I thought it was?	Uh huh.
Has this happened to you before?	Never, but I've been practicing.
Who are you, Jerry?	Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look great.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to Queens?	Not today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	This way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father's house.	Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liza?	Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?	Did you kill my father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?	Because he believed me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I believe you.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blue moon... Blue moon...	Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blue moon...	You saw me standing alone ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Without a song in my heart.	Without a love of my own.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blue moon...	You knew just what I was there for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liza?	Where are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?	I can't promise you anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They changed Franklin's portrait.	You think it's a conspiracy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, too.	Now she tells me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I know you?	Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liza Sutton is dead.	Then I can't be hurt anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You made your decision yet?	I'm leaning toward no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm still listening.	Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
<EOC>	<EOC>
In Jerry's safety deposit box.	I don't understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay.  I'm game.	I want this box rigged with a beacon!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liza, settle a bet for us.	What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Then this is a goddamn emergency.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.	Agent Lowry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, your psychotic is here.	Not today...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way did he go?	I don't know.  Didn't see him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I talk to you a second?	Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you believe me?	Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've lost contact.	Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
There's no plug to pull.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Arroway --	Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What in the hell...?	It's a hoax.  I knew it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pepsi?  Tequila?	No, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.	Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David --	Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?	Actually I'm running late --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You...	Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You aren't staying?	This... seemed best.
Right.  Well.	Good luck, David.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the status of the decryption effort?	Well --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Lunacharsky...?	Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
J39 Z186...?	Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.	Put it on speakers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't we get rid of them?	It's a civilian facility.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Small moves, Captain, small moves.	I can't move any smaller.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Talk to him.	But what do I say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pensacola.	That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I one... or many?	The librarian... or the library...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's time to go home now.	No.  Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.	It's so... small.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hokkaido Island.	The systems integration site.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellie.  Arroway.	Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.	Yavol.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellie.	Peter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's good to see you, Ellie.	You too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone tell me this is really happening.	It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?	Like it or not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Champagne please.	Make that two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellie --	It's late.  We should go back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So.  The final countdown.	The final countdown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...?	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...	That's what you're gonna have to do.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me what to do!	I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

<EOC>	<EOC>
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.	I'd like to go back. James...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't told me where we're going.	Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we allowed to park here?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you drive?	I can drive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crash victim?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you live here? With Seagrave?	I live in my car. This is my workshop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.	Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?	Yeah, and a dimple.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.	Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?	I miss Beast a lot, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up with you?	Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just go ahead and tell us.	There's nothing to tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe.	You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?	She said she'd be here at 10.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think of this one?	I'd have to see it on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Things have been kind of stressful lately.	But everything's OK?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about this one?	You look beautiful.
Really?	Truly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Mom.	Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck me.	What's the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...	I'll be back before you can say souffle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Ecru.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do we have to talk wedding details?	Oh, no, of course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's his name, Letty?	I didn't say...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did the right thing.	I ruined your wedding night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure, Dear?	Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell us every detail.	You've only known Jake a few months.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no.	Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.	Especially with a promotion in the offing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gather he's late as usual.	Can I get you a glass of champagne?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll see you soon.	Tomorrow?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.	You too, Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't had a crush since I was	When did you start smoking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm only looking out for you.	And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must you walk so quickly?	It's good exercise, Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honestly, Letty.	A deal's a deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It had this red spot on its back.	Green spot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.	It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chair, cup and ball.	Terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?   Go right ahead.	Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A while, I guess.	That must be really difficult.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Hey there. They're showing ""Groundhog Day"" if you..."	You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.	Who do you think you are?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you looking to read?	Anything interesting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you're checking it out.	I've already checked it out 17 times.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He asked me to marry him.	Very romantic setting.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.	So are you engaged, or what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you done with the ring?	It's magic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess which hand.	Enough with the abracadabra.
Guess.	The left one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really, this isn't funny.	OK, OK, I'll give it back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're supposed to be asleep.	Exactly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll get caught.	No rounds for another three hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A daisy for the lady.	The lady knows this is a dandelion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?	Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.	What are the delusions like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then it's over.	Lie down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	Home free.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me all.	I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So there were no problems?	Not a one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?	Aren't you ever quiet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow.	You like it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to see the kitchen first.	Do you like it?
I love your apartment.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	It's sex time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael.	Shhhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet.	I'll be forced to tickle you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck.	You, too. Kick ass today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This must be Beast.	That's Mr. Beast to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who ever said sanity was fun?	It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Promise?	Promise.  As long as we have steak.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four interviews. Four no-gos.	The restaurant, too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going to miss the Top Ten.	Coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.	I got worried. Are you OK?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How may I help you?	Congratulations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aunt Lily?	Bingo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?	It wasn't exactly a lie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it? Are you OK?	Always the drugs.
What?	I saw you talking to my Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean not taking your meds?	Why'd you tell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Silly?   Silly am I?	Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.	I think I should call someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess we need to talk.	I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I sure know what that feels like.	And all the plans we have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we going to do?	What do you want to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess I should go now.	You should go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.	The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.	Good going. I knew you could do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't have a fever.	I don't feel like going to work today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?	I'm going to the store.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.	Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?	That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.	Something you did?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Especially this last year.
Especially now.	So, I've been thinking a lot...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, you've done a perfect job.	So, what do you say, Let?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Getting back.	I heard about your friend.
What?	I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All tapped out.	I'll float you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zero.   That's all I know.	You'll never get out of the city.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey man, you can't do that!	What?   This?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	It's Elvis...
Who?	It's me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've already robbed the safe?	Oui.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your brother?	Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?	Uh, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.	C'mon, Laurant, America?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're gonna be what?	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tonight?	I know they won't be home tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.   We just go home.	We can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get that, will you?	Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.	I'm not any closer than you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is everything an argument with you?	I'm just setting my boundaries.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!	Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.	Where are you from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hopefully no one.	No one? Then why is Zero here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just want you there in case there's trouble.	And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!	You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!	What about the money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bring me the scissors.	And the Vodka.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Turn on the flashlight.	I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?	I think he's already figured that out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That moron.	It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We still have to get out of here.	Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, knock it off.	All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hadley --	Has to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not your fault, Daniel.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody hungry?	What'd you get?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you have to use that much explosive?	I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They don't have a wine list.	Oh, then we will have the house wine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about transportation?	You can use my car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They don't serve wine here.	What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This kind.	Okay.    I will have a beer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll drive.	I'm the driver.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I knew I should have driven.	Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When we get to the next corner jump out.	I'm not going to leave you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about Canada?	What are we going to do, take a taxi?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- I want to be Elvis.	It's my idea.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.	Okay.   You can be Elvis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's good.	God, I want to go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?	Get in the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	They sort of got away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are we going to do that?	I know where she went.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He speaks about himself in the third person?	Feel free to correct him if you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.	Watch this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we went the wrong way.	Oh, you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do we know what room she's in?	Wait here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The money isn't here.	Where is it, Sophie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't even hear myself think.	How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And how do we do that?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When do we go?	Tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever hear of jet lag?	Take a nap.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's gonna see it there?	The lucky ones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't sleep?	No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.	It's not your fault.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you waiting for?	Stick around and find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!	That's why we're only breaking one arm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're back!	How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.	Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.	I didn't have the heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	Wait!  I'm a friend!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your master?	What's it to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.  What is your name?	Long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.	Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.	So what if I don't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?	He is my defeated foe!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll socialize with whomever I please.	Don't invite danger into your father's house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This spells trouble.	I have a guest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've missed you.	How so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're doing calligraphy?	I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.	Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.	Only the sword will settle this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	What I've always wanted, to teach you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give it back!	Kneel!
Never!	Then you have no use for the sword.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lo?	Jen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's stop a moment.	Give it back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go.	Jen...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you remember the legend of the young man?	"""A faithful heart makes wishes come true."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mu Bai...It's been too long.	It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Jade Fox!	We must avenge mother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're gone.	What does it say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you're gonna tell me who.	Who ever made that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Talent. Hi.	Care for a hot dog?
You buying?	I'm buying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No onions though, okay?	No onions?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, hello there...chocolate,	Don't thank me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And I say I'm dead... and I move.	No further.  I'm serious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name.	I'm sorry as hell, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.  For giving a damn.	My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They couldn't do anything for me.	How 'bout the morgue?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't interfere.	You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
At least it finally stopped raining.	It can't rain all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look like a rock star without a job.	I dabble.  May I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you feel okay.	No.
You gotta go now, I bet.	I have to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on...?	A remembrance.  A closure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's goin' on, Elly?	I went to see a friend of mine.
Well, how's your friend?	She's still dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.	Mom tried to cook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.	I don't know you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit... you're dead, man...	Victims.  Aren't we all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cute nickname, don't you think?	I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish to possess what you have now.	I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How the hell did you do that?	Magic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Neither.	Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you?	Interested?  Follow the crow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get it?	Leave me alone -- !
<EOC>	<EOC>
Glad to see you're finally with the program.	Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be alone.	I'm already alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't waste my time.	Very well, it's your ass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blow yourself, bigmouth.	Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coupla more rings... 24k.	18k.  Crap.
...necklace... pearls...	Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got company.	Is he inside?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got him if you want him.	No shooting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Kathryn.	Annette Harrison.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	I'll be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Annette, how long have we known each other?	Forever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the water?	Refreshing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.	Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're naked.	It's my house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you reading?	Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.	Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure. Have a good night.	I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I bothering you?	Not at all. Have a seat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.	Who's Monsieur Philipe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really want to know?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't go.	Get off me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like a tour?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't working out for me anymore.	Yeah, me neither.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.	What are you saying?
Why aren't you understanding?	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I suck. I suck.	Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you for real?	Do you want to learn or not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's Kathryn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cecile, you had an orgasm.	I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.	I am?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's like a secret society.	That's one way of looking at it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What year are you in?	I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.	It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excellent.	You think he'll like it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry that was out of line.	I want to go home.
I was just kidding.	I want to go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a kiss, right?	I swear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to join me?	Some other time, Cecile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I suppose to be this sore?	For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think?	Is it me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?	No.
Want a blow job?	Good night Cecile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.	I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, mom.	Honey, is something wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nudie pictures, what do you think?	Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh baby... oh baby...	Baby?  Right on time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.	Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Greg, is that you under the covers?	Get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa!	I told you to lock the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.	Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pleased to meet you.	Likewise I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Ronald?
Yeah?	It's Kathryn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.	Outstanding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?	Could you be more desperate to read it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can put it anywhere.	Even there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck her yet?	I'm working on it.
Loser.	Blow me.
Call me later.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You would not believe what--	Shhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm at your service.	Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moving along quite well.	Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.	Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you calling?	Cecile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That her?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning!	Morning.
So? How'd it go last night?	With who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bad time?	Kind of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some other time.	Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.	And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.	I want to fuck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why so nervous?	I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?	Screening calls. Any suggestions?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought we should celebrate.	I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Ronald?	Not that it's any of your business but yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done.	Thank you. Now, where were we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
In any event, you still owe me my reward.	I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get off me!	Will you calm down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't thank you enough.	You will be discreet about this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me get that for you.	Oh please. I can't have you do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's desperate that I talk to her.	I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.	I'll do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.	Do you know where she is?
She's out.	Do you know when she'll be back?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -	Annette! Annette!
Young man, I already told you she's not here.	Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do that.	It's really important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right after we played backgammon.	We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.	I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.	Excuse me?

Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
L.A.P.D.	<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damnit...	What?
Glasses.	Just don't shoot me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need to speak to you.	Give me a minute, will ya?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that for?	Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She is Lana Turner.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm curious about you.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was I?	Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You sound like you mean it.	The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?	You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.	You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.	You, me and White, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My daughter was a virgin!	I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.	Sid, it's Vincennes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not a word.	What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're back, boychick.	Sid, how are they hanging?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have we met before?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was it a party?	Something like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
DePinto's dead.	Oh Jesus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know anything about Zavitz.	You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<EOC>	<EOC>
209 to anyone! I need some help here!	Who are you calling?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got it on tape?	Clear as day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No one. But I'm a little nervous.	When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.	Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I'll come straight there.	Be careful, Danny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell us about Rachel Banks.	Rachel Banks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of a question is that?	A direct one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you call anyone?	What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.	Look, my wife is understandably--
Jesus!	I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?	I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?	I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?	You told me no calls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Looks like Detroit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is one ugly sunrise.	It really is.  Did you find anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck?!	They shouldn't have come without calling first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gimme that.	You sure?
You're driving.	Those are Feds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think we let out enough air?	Oh my God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We lost 'em.	That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.	Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
These guys are incredibly persistent.	Tell me about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty fast.	We'll have to re-stock some basics.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He came in four minutes ago.	C'mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feeling lucky?	Not particularly, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Mr. Dean.	Hello. Hello, Maria.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it okay?	You got any money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Uh-oh.	Listen to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does that hurt?	Well...yeah.
Good.	Stacy--
<EOC>	<EOC>
...who root through...uh...presents, and...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure you're safe?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're saying you killed that policeman.	That's gonna end tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it over?	It's over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.	It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.	Here, you can use this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My suitcase--	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.	Don't count on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Actually, that's not true.	You didn't squeeze DePinto?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Soon"". Or at least sooner than never."	It's how he works.
Brill?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't.	You have to.
I've never met him?	Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't <u>give</u> me--	--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?	We'd rather not--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus! What?! You want money?!	Shut the fuck up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your shoe.	My shoe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's his name?	Brill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.	Mr. Dean--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Robert--	Where's Stacy?
She doesn't want to talk to you.	What are you talking--
She can't talk to you right now.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're learning a cruel lesson.	Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.	Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.	Really?
In your dreams.	Dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's kidding.	Where's mom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long can you stay?	I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay to use the phone.	Alright!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, man.	No. No, it's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bobby? Piece of advice?	Yeah?
Turn yourself in.	Jerry?
Yeah?	Go fuck yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was Zavitz in trouble?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think there was a connection to--	Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well we'd sure like to help you.	You would?
Yes. But we can't.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd have to--	Get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about--	We don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Puffed cheese?
No thank you.	I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?	No.
Then let's assume I don't.	Yes sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now is that clear?	Yes sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Actually, you sing.	Pardon?
You sing.  All the time.	I do not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should come into the shelter.	I'm quite all right, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not very good, is it?	No.
Shall we be all right?	Yes.  Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do they know them?	No, but I think I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you not come in?	No.
Will you please come in?	Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Don't.	I believe you still have my book.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say you're sick.	What?  No!
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can still taste you.	This is empty, just coming!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!	You bastard, I was believing you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did he bring you?	A surprise, he said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.	We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.	I know, darling, I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you hate me?	What?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?	Don't talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A broken car?	Still a car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen Katharine?	What?
It's Geoffrey under this.	I haven't, no.  Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, either shut up, or go home.	Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.	Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Supper. Hana calls after him.	Where've you been?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buon' giorno.	She can take you as far as Florence.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thought you'd never wake up!	What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Irving Berlin.	For?
Top Hat.	Is there a song you don't know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The team is in mourning, darling.	Oh really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you asleep?	Yes.  Dropping off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Captain McGann.	Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll probably marry him.	Really?  That's sudden.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Arguing about books.	Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm still here.	You'd better be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.	Would you like me to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?	Never heard of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not sewing anything else for you!	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
For my hair?	Yes, for your hair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would anyone do this?	I've done this.  I've had to do this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kip - come and dance with me	Yes.  Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is hot!	Nya-nya-nya!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gone, hasn't he?	No.  He's - no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa - give me a chance!	Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!	Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.	Go away.
Yessir.	This is making me incredibly angry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Darling, Peter says I could stay	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is wonderful!	What's he saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.	There are times when you don't answer the phone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So he popped the pane?	Bingo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ordering chop suey again?	Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's doable.	And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have a question...	Who am I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about if I try humility.	How about if you try disappearing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have a car?	Uh, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seems I am.	I'll call an ambulance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got something...	I sincerely hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not taking me seriously.	Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't expect you to be so...	So what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you mind?	You...you can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're shaking. Are you nervous?	No. Why would I be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got something for you.	Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For God's sake.	I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We going somewhere?	Possibly.
Maybe I should drive this time.	Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very nice.	Not a word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a test.	That's my girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a fake.	Give him the card.
But--	Can you follow simple directions?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A film case.	That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He says they turned the card down.	Damn, I knew I forgot something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Motorcycle.	Got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's one way.	We're only going one way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to die, aren't we...	I'm not the one to ask...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about your bags?	I never carry...baggage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those are my clothes.	Certainly not mine. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stole my luggage? You--	I'm a thief. Sue me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's entrapment.	No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late.	<u>I'm</u> dressed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?	We're doing this together. We're partners.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I go in alone.	You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!	A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.	It was perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?	Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't we take oxygen?	We are...for the tools.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's do it again.	Try laps. Say a hundred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I hear a car?	Our equipment has arrived.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't mean to get personal.	Yes you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it.	Charged?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it. We're ready.	One more item--not on the check list.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I trust it's your size.	It's---beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.	I've got something for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't we early?	Little celebration before we set off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To us. To the Mask.	To our...partnership.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wasn't.	So you had to be your own lifeline.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Camera in the--	Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--	In eye of that painting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're working.	It's a party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One, two, three...	You're not on the beat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you see the other PIRs?	Got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They moved it.	Behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful not to break the laser beams.	Duh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Careful...careful.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We did it.	The Mask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now's when you tell me who you really are.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, you're a thief.	Yes. Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
STOP! You're making...mistake.	It's your mistake.
The big job.	There is no big job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	A billion dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your share.	Get the hell in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're living history here.	You don't know the half of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like banks.  That's where the money is.	Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hmmm...44 long.	I always knew you'd do the job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got everything planned.	Everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.	There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?	Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god, I thought--	I'd taken the Mask?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the rules?	My job, my rules.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...What are we doing?	You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peoples China Bank.	Where the money is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The oscilloscope's already programmed.	It's no good without the argon gas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how long till we do this?	We're doing it tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do I look?	Like a woman of mystery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pulse detectors.	Charged.
Parachute.	Packed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way to take another day or two?	No. You'll see when we get inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shouldn't have.	Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have something in mind?	Call it a new tradition.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a lifetime ago.	It was wrong to deceive you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But would you--would you--	Have really held you under?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.	Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not for me.	What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The sign of our partnership.	Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Relax, don't jam it...	FUCKING THING!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...	The disc is still in there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The door's the only way out!	I sincerely hope not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	You can do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.	No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hang on.	Get out of here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I cannot get rid of you.	No, you can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put this on!	I'm not leaving without you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--You're a cop.	Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it is.	It better be worth it for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.	Remind me why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two make quite a couple.	We're supposed to.
You better not be taking on a new partner.	Suspicious, after all these years?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tonight your league night?	Check out my ball.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.	Yes it does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you.	Probably not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where've you been?	What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.	Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's she doing here?	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fax these to this number, okay?	All of 'em?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Donna Irving?	Yes?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?	You're a lawyer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The judge came up with a number.	A number for the whole group, or for us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can put them in a good school.	Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All I have is hundreds.	I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You do know how to do that, don't you?	Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then I don't get anything either.	And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.	That's crazy -- why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that what I think it is?	She lived on the plume.  You never know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanna talk about --	<u>No</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone's following me.	What?  Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Counts?	Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why good?	He's got a reputation for doing all his --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!	Not in my world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How dare you take that away from me.	No one's taking anything --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning!	Erin?  What are you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.	How do you know that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	Take it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When'd they file the demur?	Yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's the judge?	Corey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you were told to destroy those?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pattee?  That your middle name?	Nope.  Maiden.
You're married.	Not anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.	How come you're not eating?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy, can I get a flower?	Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.  A real moron.	Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Ros, where are they?	In the conference --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I play roller hockey?	We'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come her own mom isn't helping her?	Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Annabelle Daniels.	Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.	Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.	Yeah, and whose fault is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.	Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing?	Better safe than sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	Fixing a leak under your sink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great.	I'm gonna clean it up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Ed.	Lock the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?  What are you doing?	Thinking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Mm-hm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And I miss you.	Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.	I will.  Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone stole my stuff.	Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?	Yeah.  Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something else, too.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.  It's an awful lot.	I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My lord.	Come in, Admiral.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He will learn patience.	Much anger in him, like in his father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't ...	You must.  Luke, look at me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.	Everyone's invited, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barks a blue streak.	What's wrong with him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three patrol ships are heading our way.	Barks an argument and shakes his head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.	Okay, okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howls.	We're not out of this yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it's been awhile.	Barks and growls at his boss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barks his concern.	No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barks at his master.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should have stayed and finished them off.	Barks his agreement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... the power?	Howls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barks his consternation.	Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.	Barks his agreement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me that!	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, I was wondering ...	Sit down, and shut up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It sounds like it's trying to get in.	I'm going to see what it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would it help if I got out and pushed?	Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was no earthquake.	Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.	Would you please stop calling me that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.	Yes, you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop that.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something out there!	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see it Chewie, hang on.	The entrance is collapsing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.	We have no use for your kind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you say?	I didn't say anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!	Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The deflector shields are gone.	Are the coordinates set?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?	Not yet.  They're working on it now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Closer?!	Closer?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A tremor!	Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What??	Oh my, no!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rather touchy, aren't they.	I thought you knew this person.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leia!	Luke, no!  It's a trap.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This hyperdrive had better work.	I've never seen it fail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have followed my feelings.	You are reckless!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe it.	That is why you fail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.	I thought those seekers were set for stun!
That they are.	They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And sacrifice Han and Leia?	If it must be.  Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody's going to believe it.	Believe what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zira, are you mad?	Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --	And we can watch ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, Lewis?	There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?	No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go easy, Stevie.	They look pretty docile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We shall want a full autopsy ...	With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.	He's a gorilla.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I say something personal?	Please
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	You never heard of Snake Plissken?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ooww!	Go on now. Do as I say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.	You told me he was dead.
I thought he was, but he came back.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Cuervo...	What?
It's so good to see you again.	Where's Plissken?
He's... near.	You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?	My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need a favor.	What's in it for me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.	Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.	I got a new deal for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you in hell, Snake.	If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.	Somebody get off!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's in the green.	Lock fuel rods.
Locked.	Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
<EOC>	<EOC>
75% power.	Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Plissken...?	I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.	It's history. I gotta go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Getting ready to invade.	So where's Plissken?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it?	Right over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me too?	We'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aw, come on, Snake.	Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know about this thing.	Don't like it, don't come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing in here?	Looking to get out.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.	Which way?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.	Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't follow me.	You need help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do we get out of here?	Sewers. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you gonna do in Venice?	Find Cuervo Jones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Run, Snake...They're coming.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.	Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Well, I'll think it over.	You're running out of time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.	Thank God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the anti-toxin...?	Give me the prototype.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, what's going down, Snake?	I'm looking for somebody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All of us?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When you threw it in, what did you see?	...I saw nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yield. I have the advantage.	I will not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?	It is deep...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Arthur.	Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
At last...	Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He can be no other.	Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is Merlin?	Speak of the devil!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You saved me from the arrow...	But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.	That's not why you came.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A king must marry, after all.	...of course...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?	Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father...	Rise, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.	I recognize you only as my son, no more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I left it in the tent, sir.	Well hurry then, and get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It didn't hurt too much, did it?	Ye...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.	Don't start a war on my wedding day!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The law forbids it.	Love demands it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are things about love--	--Nothing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't he kill us?	He has given up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.	You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very well. Climb up.	I will run.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.	Twenty days!? The world is that big?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...	The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They do.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You provoke me, Merlin.	What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.	Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now you must pay me.	I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The oath. You didn't say--	You didn't ask!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What honey?	Fuck it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	In here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi	Hi, how'd your day go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did the doctor say?	We have to start looking for a shrink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!	I can't believe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you want this?	What is it?
Phonograph.	Storage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna miss you.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like some more coffee?	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, she'd love it.	What's her name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're a nice man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But it's clean?	All right then we've got clean rats.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. No rats.	I just heard them Karl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is nothing.	Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!	No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bastard! I will kill you.	Karl!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me Miss?	What!
A man to see you.	What man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?	No thanks Karl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning.	Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?	Fine thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it coming out Willie?	Yes, I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chris MacNeil?	Please go away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?	No.
Did you know my mother died recently?	Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?	Not at all. Why d'you ask?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wanna drink.	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No it's alright I'll take it straight.	Are you sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Regan's father?	In Europe.
Have you told him what's happening?	No
<EOC>	<EOC>
She...killed Burke Dennings.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. He's already here.	Father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is she gonna die?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, not while we're in Washington.	Oh............
We'll see when we get home okay.	When can I have one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh look at that.	You like it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, where'd this come from?	I found it.
Where?	The closet
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've been playing with it?	Yeah.
You know how?	Here I'll show you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute you need two.	No you don't. I do it all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Regan, why are you reading that?	Cause I like it.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.	I wouldn't talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
People get tired.	Why does God let us get tired?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God!	Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want it.	Honey it's to help you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All done.	Honey this is Father Dyer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Chris. Great party.	Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She doesn't remeber a thing.	That's good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye Father. I call you.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think you can sleep?	Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight Dims.	Stealing is a sin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'd like that?	Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?	It would bring us together.
You and Regan?	You and us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you do that?	Uh Huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do it again.	In time.
No now.	In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You speak Latin?	Ego te abslovo.
Quod nomen mihi est?	Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?	La plume de ma tante.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?	Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Holy water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm all right.	How's your leg?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.	Oh really, when?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!	And let my cry come unto thee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.	Amen
<EOC>	<EOC>
Amen.	Defender of the human race...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up!!	... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Her heart.
Can you give her something?	She'll go into coma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not my mother!!!	Don't listen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
MERRIN!!!!!!!	Are you tired?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss?	Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.	Do you have an appointment?
Yes	Are you a relative?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son	Just a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you comfortable Regan?	Yes.
How old are you?	Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?	Sometimes.
Who is it?	I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me the keys.	You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys!	You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!	It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frankie.	You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Yeah, come on in.	Little slow tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Your pay.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.	Take it now.
What about tomorrow?	We don't need you, Frankie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trunks?	Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.	Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Maybe next time.	We have some lotion.
Just the same.	Suit yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, look at this.	You bring trunks, Jack?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beasley.	Baker.
What's our friend's problem?	Teeth.
What's wrong with them?	They're falling out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You the magician?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Piano.	Two at a time?
My brother and I. One each.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!	How's the birthday girl?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?	Out.
When they coming in?	Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the gig?	Two nights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with it?	You look like you just crawled out of bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't make trouble, all right?	Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.	Like an angel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Count it.	Huh?
Count it.	Jack...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What d'ya got?,	Bosen black.  Flat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What d'ya got?	Yamaha white.  Nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Try the black Knable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.	What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?	Funny.  Strike a bell?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.	It's more than that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what'd we get her?	You'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I made her nervous.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's with Charlie?	Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you'll come out, right?	Yeah, okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.	Your doorbell doesn't work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A gust of wind killed him.	Yeah, and what put him up there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.	Talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.	Let's get it over with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	I didn't get her number.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose we can bring it down a little.	I'll drop the eighths.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell is she?	It's early.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.	She'll get here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hit me.	I told you I was gonna hit you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.	You're a fucking alarm clock.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.	She's here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Here, how's this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See anything?	How about these?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something, huh?  All those bids.	Yeah.  Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.	You wanna get a drink?

<EOC>	<EOC>
November.  '71.	First night?
Day.  Wednesday.	Last?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's drunk.	Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have some more wine, Frank.	Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Funny, huh?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack, you're on television.	Shut up, Frank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack!	Who's weak now, big brother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't hear you come in.	What're you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like these got a few years on them.	This'll kill 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your limo's ready, Ma.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sick?  How sick?	The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.	Doctor's orders.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh... he knows it.	Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This where the auditions are?	This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?	We're finished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're an hour and a half late.	My watch is broken, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.	What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So?	Uh ... we'll let you know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	When we know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.	Hey!
Come on.  We don't have much time.	Time for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Uh... good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shoes?	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The switch.  Hit the switch.	Switch?  What fucking switch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it's legit.	Maybe.  I'll call him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two could play checkers.	Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead.	Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, we're connected.	Great.
Great?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding me.	As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?	Tell her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, will you look at that?	They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?	I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess I ... If I jumped to...	Forget it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatcha doin' over there?	Gotta go.
How come?	Job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Funny hours.	Funny job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barker.  Jock Barker?	Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.	Come on, Ed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to know if he's okay. Right?	Yeah.
All right.  Hold on.	The name's Baker --
Save it.  What's he look like?	Black.  Labrador.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?	Downstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You miss him, don't you?	It's been a long time, Ma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, he's not sore, is he?	He'll come around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never sang before?	Not for money. With my mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's egghead?	His kid's sick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He do that every year?	Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?	Every year.
So why's he do it?	I guess in case one year they're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.	Hey, business is business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.	Just dinner and dance, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Relax.  We'll drop the song.	Guess I got a little scattered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can keep the beat.	Better than that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to make him some chili. Okay?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
History.	Huh?
My father proposed to my mother in there.	No kidding?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The both of them?  In there?	He called her.
Oh. So what's it doing here?	Long story.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank said ---	Frank wasn't 'there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.	Coffee?
Yeah... No.	Look, if you want to leave...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.  I think I started a fire.	If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can always get another girl.	There's always another girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me get the light.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.	Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.	It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you break a cup, Jack?	Eddie did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ivory.	Looks old.
Older than me.	Wow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd the show go?	Okay.  How'd yours go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merry Christmas, Jack.	Merry Christmas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John.  It's good to see you.	Good to see you, Ma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. How are you?	Fine.  You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Big piece or little?	Huh? Oh, no.
None?	I'm not much for sweets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he do?	He hit a guard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.	Yeah -- me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, Castor.	Drive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perfect fit.	Should be.  It's yours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pollux ...	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not the worst part.	What's worse than losing five million bucks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is he?	No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What -- what are you doing?	Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jamie ...	Shoot him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're too tight.	So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll what?	I'm going to have you fired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got someone in your office.	Get rid of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll need to recultivate that virus.	No problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is with you tonight?	Don't I usually kiss my wife?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.	Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're wearing your suit --	Call me spontaneous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	-- Studying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll deal with her later.	Good.  Because I'm fed up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, and Oxxford called...	Ooh, my suits are ready...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have kids, Jack?	Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And I know people.	Im sure you do...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take you, for instance...	What about me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.	I dont think youre hearing me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack, are you okay?	Whats going on here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	But I think I like you better this way...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	So what are we gonna do, Jack?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rise...and...shine...!	Youre jumping, sweetheart...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were almost done here...	Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...	Wheres my real dad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do I go now?	Big Eds.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?	Thats where you work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very nice. What is it?	Mary Had A Little Lamb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Ringing my bell...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it morning yet?	No, honey. Go back to sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see, its like were in each others heads...	Kates my wife...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got a minute, Jack?	Ive got all the time in the world...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like I said, it's a business deal...	Damn, you are the real thing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you know my name was Jack?	"I call all you white guys ""Jack."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?  What do you need?	Me?
You just said everyone needs something.	I've got everything I need.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...	What the hell is happening to me?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?  Look at the ticket...!	Get out, I call 911.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like the dress...?	Its lovely...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finger food...?	I dont think so, thank you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we...?	Are we what, Jack?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we finally being honest?	It would help me if we were.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merry Christmas to you, sir...	Thanks.  To you too...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...	If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?	Okay, chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...	No, youre right.  What are we doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't seem to let go of you...	You hear me complaining about that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	Yeah...fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of man does that!?	I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?	Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello!	...my feet are hurtin...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh...that babys crying...	And...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?	That is the general idea, yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can you do that?	Do what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?	She got those shoes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our life in a nutshell...	If you want to look at it that way...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cmon.	Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want the cake!?	I want it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you...	Its good, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not it...?	Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.	Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe I should wait...	No, open it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are incredible...	Enjoy it, sweetheart...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.	But Im gettin close, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need to tell you something.	Okay...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good things...	What are you sure about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...	Thats all I wanted to hear...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could stay here forever...	I dont think Id fight you on that one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty incredible, isnt it?	Its like a museum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This place is a perk, Kate.	A perk for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Its been interesting, thats for sure.	But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I promise, Jack...	Promise me again...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kate...	Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look great.	Its good to see you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry...	Dont worry about it, Jack...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...	We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter Lassiter...	Do I know you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He certainly has your number, Alan.	Youre a little tougher, Peter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For one thing, you like expensive things.	Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I help you?	Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn...damn...damn...	Hey, are you okay?
No...Im not...	Is there anything I can do for you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to see you again.	I'd like that, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.	So we'll get egg nog.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you have anywhere to go?	I've got plenty of places to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thats totally see through...	Merry Christmas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ill go for a cup of coffee!	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you know it was me?	I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not really dressed for a party.	Relax, it's casual.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't take this.	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The shields on the station should protect us.	<u>Should</u>?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.	Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the --!	Ben.  Are you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!	Go back to the drawing board.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?	Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it.  Everything I want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ben, come in.	What is this?  Where's Reed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Where is Reed</u>?	Victor must've taken him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...	That's terrible news...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not responsive --	Ben!  Ben!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back it down, Johnny!	I can go hotter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.	But all these people...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me like-y.	Stay right.  Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.	Last one down springs for room service.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're on fire!	Not this again --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Apparently I can disappear.	<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it.	"Okay, ""mom."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that <i>thing</i>?	I think that thing is Ben.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm driving.	Dude.  That's my sister.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two need a time-out.	Blockhead started it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --	No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're ready for you, sir.	Showtime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?	Hilarious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Ben, come on...	Reed, we're running out of time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--	Never better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.	What?  What do you mean you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	We need to get past them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.	What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?	Are you kidding?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?	No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can...make it work.	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --	You <u>need</u> a doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found a broken gasket, from space --	A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?	I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Raising the shields.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Victor, are you feeling alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just <u>find</u> him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do we stand?	Medical's ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay to proceed.	Phase Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.	Message to Proteus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you to cut down on the sugar.	I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?	I'd hold that off awhile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- and why we need you.	<Me>?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.	Here's the Surgeon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?	No question of her loyalty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.	Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just one, General...	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]	I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Difficult? He's impossible!	That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen...the Heart.	Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doctor...	Yes, Cora.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.	They're much smaller than bacteria...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.	Now I know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.	I always thought it was nothing but red.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.	But I did. I'm positive!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then how come it worked loose?	I have no idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't you answer that?	Not now. We need air, not greetings!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Open it! Open it before they get here!	I can't till the hatch is flooded!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No need to get up --	I feel much better now...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you for saving my life.	That's what they pay me for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Such as?	Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doctor, what's wrong?	I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can we do?	Nothing -- against all that force.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --	You left something out.
What's that?	The Breath of God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?	No, there's no other way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said there was a quick way out!	What about Dr. Michaels?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.	How are you, Miss Peterson?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell them to take us out.	If there's any chance --
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I?	Go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you do that for?	I'm married.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?	Sort of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...	Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any reserve air?	Enough to breathe, but that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on -- it's no use!	We can get out through the Lab Section.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it look?	I could use a lawnmower...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it...	Looks simple to operate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll never find my way through that.	I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.	Then don't drift down further.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!	May I have your ticket, please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Is this a fucking joke?	Unghh... oh, geez...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or your fucking wife, you know.	Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unguent.	Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clear him off the road.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She started shrieking, you know.	Jezhush.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.	We split that.
<EOC>	<EOC>

This is do-able.	Congratulations, Jerry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm tellin' ya.	Well... Why don't we...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That wouldn't interest you.	Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --	Right, right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are a moron.	I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cornelius!  How are you?	Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.	"Really?  Great.  Still ""Remaining Men Together?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.	Yeah, both of us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that your blood?	Some of it, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It becomes an addiction.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.	Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like this is goodbye.	Let's not make a big thing out of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?	Should we?
In case we want to switch nights.	I suppose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where have you been the last few weeks?	Marla?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	What... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's time for you to leave.	Don't worry, I'm leaving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?  Here?	Here.
There?	Here.
Here.	Feel anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Make sure.	Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.	No... no problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think everything's okay here.	I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.	Well... thanks, anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Paper Street Soap Company.	Can I come in?
He's not here.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened... ?	Don't ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, you're shot...	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... and you come home to this.	You fucking slut!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is how I met --	Tyler Durden.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?	No, supply oxygen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess so.	And, now it's gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.	Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.	Delivered from Martha Stewart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.	Like hell.  That counted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?	My dad.  No question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your car?	What car?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you reading?	Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unbelievable, huh?	He was obviously able to handle it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're sure?	Yeah, I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're okay with this?	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to finish her off?	Uh... nah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get rid of her.	Don't mention me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this place?	A liposuction clinic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No thanks, I quit.	You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?	Work.  Going to work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What... ?	Nothing.  Do what you like.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Six months advance pay.  Six months!	Fucking sweet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's fight club in Delaware City.	I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we doing?	Homework assignment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I asked you what you studied.	Tell him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel sick.	Imagine how he feels.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?	I felt like destroying something beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something on your mind?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This conversation...	... is over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're too young.  Sorry.	Wait a minute...
<EOC>	<EOC>
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..	This is not about martyrdom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm pulling the green wire.	Green?  Did you say green?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tyler...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ask me nicely.	Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn it!  God-damn it...	Not exactly according to plan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
NO...	Proceed with remote detonation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?	It's the only way to get rid of you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do something for me.	What?
Appreciate something.	What?
Look at me...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean?	Do you know where I found this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.	Next time lets put some money on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.	I know.  Sorry, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.	I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ready?	Wait...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, hello?	WB2YKXB, who've I got?

Sorry 'bout that.	What'd you just say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?	W...B...2...YXB.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell...	I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Nothing...I just spilled something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god.	What?
You just burned the desk.	What's happening?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's impossible.	What if it's not...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad...?	Johnny...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sound...ground up...?	I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...	1998.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's really you, isn't it?	Yeah...I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, not yet.	Too busy playin' ball, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!	It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...	I don't understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	October 22, 1969.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hang on a sec, John.	You there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.	H-hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John, you still there?	I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?	Yeah, I think so...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.	Hang on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, what the hell is going on?	Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John, you there?	Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.	We did it, John.  We stopped him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.	What the hell is that smell?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you feeling?	Better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John.  John, you all right?	Longbranch...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not looking too good.	Whoa, I just...I just...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another rough night, huh?  That it?	Yeah.  That's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got a minute?	Yeah.  Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.	Sounds good.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.	Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how'd you like LION KING?	Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.	You work too hard, John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You used to be on the job?	Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I look familiar?	No.  What house you work?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The 2-3.  Homicide.	A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.	I hear that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No more... I can't!	Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you gonna do?	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Breakfast?	No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	Where's Shelly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think you can figure it out?	I'll think of something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want a beer or not?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!	Yes, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a slow eater.	I love you, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's dark down there.	That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we should do some exercise.	This is all the exercise I need...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?!	Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are they saying?	I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on down!	You go ahead...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Your bed.
A hammock?	Have you ever made love in a hammock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Derek... stop.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shelly!  Where are you?!	Are you all right, Shelly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened that night?	You promised you'd never ask me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could we move a little faster?	Sure, just watch where you're going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know him?	Sort of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	You're Shelly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What d'ya got in there?	My whole world.
In that little thing?	Stick around and you'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we gonna do?	Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faster!  Eat faster!	Why don't you help us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is... is everything all right?	Everything's gonna be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please... be cool.	May be please have the wallet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they following us?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't see anything.	Keep looking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got any good ideas?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is no time to celebrate!	Just keep your eyes on the road.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bullseye!	Stop the car!  Now!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought that was the end of the song.	Great.  Just great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Go out and plug the cord back in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.	No way...  ...I wanna rock!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Darren, we better turn around.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.	We're gonna scare him?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.	Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that all you found?	I wish it was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ahh, nothing.	I could swear I heard...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jason who?	Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all over.	It's just beginning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what are ya drawin'?	What's it to ya?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There...Ya happy?	No.
Why?	'Cause it stinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, give it back.	Come and get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.	Wait a minute. I just...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They did show up.  Isn't that great?	I hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.	Did you hear me?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean you had a bad dream.	No, he was real.  Like on TV.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?	Nancy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get this?	I found it outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But what if they try and scare us?	We'll scare 'em right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.	Yeah, we're here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's goin' on?	I think somebody's messin' around out there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta show you Jason's grave.	I've seen it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doesn't that tell you something?!	Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, let's hope not!	Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...	The what?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything else?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything going okay?	It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?	Not so bad, today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steven buggin' you?	Do you have to ask?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta get back to work.	Okay, I'll call you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the problem here?	N...nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello...	June the 19th.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.	Okay.
Good night, beautiful.	'Night, Josh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!	That's what I'd like to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's beautiful.	Her name's Stephanie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wanna know how I did that?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my dear God...	He was dead.  He had to be dead...
<EOC>	<EOC>
A major prick.	What are you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was truly excellent.	Yeah.
Time to check out the waiters.	I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...how do you feel?	Ask me in about five minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear that?	Hear what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.	And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?	Rennie's not coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the radio?	It's...dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	The fire alarm...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dear Christ...	We have to get off this ship!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jason's here in New York.	Don't be ridiculous!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing in here?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get that alcohol?	I packed it. Just for us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.	Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I demand to know what is going on...	Oh dear God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I doubt very much that one even exists.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do with Rennie??	Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a beautiful day.	Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I...I can't...	You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.	I'm staying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You had me worried to death!	But Sean said...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get in the boat, Rennie!	I...I can't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything okay?	Just felt a little chill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't swim.	I gathered that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rennie...	Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.	We changed our minds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got you a present.	But I didn't get you one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...	What do you mean???
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't mean for you to go!	Just radio for help, okay???
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rennie...??	The window...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rennie...what'd they do to you??	Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to call the police...	Please, hurry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I used to drive a taxi.	Where you're going, mister?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must abandon.	What do you mean, we must abandon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must abandon.	Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Under the Manhattan Bridge.	That's where I peed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guys ready to order?	Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Elliot?	This is a great young out-of-work actress.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say it again.	Alla puttanesca.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.	Shut up, Elliot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.	Press a button and they give us money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very dangerous.	Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.	Do not inhale.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it safe?	Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.	I say we go.
You say we go?	Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.	Here we go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Don't wait Efor me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He carries a gun.	Then you should carry a gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great game.	Unbelievable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.	What are you talking about?
What are we talking about?	Yes. What are you implying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course I saw it.	Did you see the winning run score?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be it.	This could be it.
Let's work on it.	Let's work on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could Pbe it.	This could be it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?	Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.	This could be it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will we talk about?	Everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will I believe you when you tell me something?	There's nothing left for me to lie about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why won't you tell me your name?	It's only our first date.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What else?	Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?	A flat-out hit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you're wondering about the firearm.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I really so deeply repugnant?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great game. Red Sox are winning.	They're always winning. Until they lose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Life is good.	Life is good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
People are dependable.	I don't know if I can say that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All the failures, all the fatalism.	Washed away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be it!	This could be it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Life is true.	Life is real.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.	Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?	Right here. At the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.	Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?	I'm on my way to get a haircut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a complicated subject.	It's a simple subject.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Matthew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry. It's a test.	It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be it!	This could be it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate the Mets.	How come?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have to hurry back.	Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Game six is history,pal.	You're not making sense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's good?	We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? Come on, Paisley.	Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Yes.	He goes to the theater armed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.	I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.	I'm going home to my machine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.	They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oww!	Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please! You're being foolish!	There's no room! And the air is lovely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God gave you ten thumbs.	Eleven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enough.	One more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just an admirer...	Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was lucky.	I thought you were a man of God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Going nearer to God!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"They're calling you ""Bapu."" I thought it meant father."	It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say?	He said he's in charge...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me -- do you think about hell?	"""Hell!"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take your luggage back, baas.	No, no -- just a moment, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can we do?	We must end the campaign.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're an ambitious man.	I hope not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's beautiful.	Even as a boy I thought so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you remember much of South Africa?	A great deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need your help!	There is nothing I can give.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you have a glass of sherry?	Thank you. No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps some tea?	I dined at the prison.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.	Somehow I expected not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you read his magazine?	No -- but I think I'm going to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could we cut all news off? I know --	Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much extra?	It would be five thousand more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.	This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you waiting for?	Where do we start?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.	Where did you get this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We believe we have a suspect.	What a relief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twelve have a mission within the week.	This time I will supervise each test personally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Jerome--?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good to see you're feeling better.	"Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your ""friends""?"
It's about the Director.	Again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?	Six one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay, Jerome?	Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It needs work.	You had to be a right-hander.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get out of here.	You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!	Keep going!!  Keep going!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.	You know I'm scared of heights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right.	I'm proud of you, Vincent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call German.	Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What makes them think that?	They found my eyelash.
Where?	In a corridor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really had other offers?	I'm sure I could have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you taking her?	Michael's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you, Jerome?	Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.	I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why have you done this?	In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?	I'm travelling too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will happen to the others?	"They are not babies, Maria, merely ""human possibilities""."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vincent...Vincent...	German, is that you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can wear lifts.	Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hugo!  I've found him!	I've found him too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.	We were just looking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have they found our friend?	Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.	They found an eyelash.
Where?	In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?	Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.	You celebrate, Jerome?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't know?	Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You're angry--	Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I envy you, Jerome.	You'll be next.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course I think about it every day.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you didn't do it after all.	I guess somebody beat me to it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are we leaving?	Those checks take forever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't.	Come on.
My medication.  I left it back there.	We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--when you go away.	We could go together one day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A year is a long time.	Not so long--just once around the sun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this, Lamar?	New policy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flight got you nervous?	There's a problem, Lamar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The doctor will give you something.	I'm not doing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The name?  For the certificate.	Antonio--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...	I heard about you. You work with Miller.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, McCoy.	Beynon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three... Rudy got ambitious.	And you got him...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll try again.	No way. I've got to get out now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to drive?	My license expired, let's get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel good?	Yeah.
Where do you want to go?	I want to take a walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't look like that.	What do you mean? You've never been there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's Beynon got set up?	Small town, small bank, big money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Half a million.	That Beynon's got a long arm.
What do you want for dinner?	Whisky and a peach.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does it taste?	Just the way I remembered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You go out much?	After four years and now the question comes up.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.	I'm still here, Doc.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait... give me a minute.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be okay.	Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Really?	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was it?	Better than I remembered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was going to fix you breakfast.	You were asleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
$250,000 right off the top.	Is he straight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know how I feel?	My mind's not on guessing games.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the bank?	Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doc...	I see it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
A man helped me open it...	And switched keys.
He must have.	It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long ago.	Fifteen minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There better be a guy with the	You bastard...
<EOC>	<EOC>
There may be a hunting party.	Why, there's nothing on the news?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're full of ifs.	I think you liked it with him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That would be the first time.	When are you going to learn?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only one car.	Let's do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	El Paso.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?	Twenty eight hundred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you hungry?	Not now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?	I think so... I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No scars?	No scars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.	It's all a game, don't bother me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We better stick here till tonight.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to make it.	Sure...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to say something.	I don't want to hear it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds good.	You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?	I don't see how.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	You and me.
Can we make it?	We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're crazy.	Get your clothes on, move your butt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, come on.	Who was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long before this car's hot?	Pull over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?	We walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.	I really hope you have a nice trip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hope you get to where you're going.	Thanks. Hope you do too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.	Where?
Chicago.	You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.	What about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drive.	Suit yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?	I kinda doubt it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way?	Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Don't you want to go to the airport?	Not now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?	Just... tell us what you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of car do you have, Harold?	A Ford... We have a Ford.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got to stop.	I'll tell you when.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.	Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't get away from me, Albert.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You knew what I'd do.	Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?	This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?	Yeah.
Well, he drove it into the river.	Was the steering faulty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the brakes?	Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?	He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I made a mistake.	What?
I made a mistake.	What about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who paid you to see me off?	I can't Jack. How can I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, don't Jack, don't.	Who sent you, Thorpey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's he living these days?	He's got a new place at Burnham.
Address?	On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyhing go off all right?	Fine...  I want to talk to you.
What about?	Doreen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really.	I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I want to talk to you later.	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know Sid Fletcher?	What?
You know Sid Fletcher?	I work for him.
Do you?	Yes, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know him too.	Who?
Sid Fletcher.	Oh, do you?
Yes.	No, do you really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. I met him last year.	Go on.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.	Really?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We went about together.	Really?
Yes, while he was here.	While he was here. You went about together?
He was here for four days.	Was he?
Could you do me a favour?	Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's setting you up in this place?	Brumby.
Is he coming here?	Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?	He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?	Especially when I play the lead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's why you waited for me.	Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?	Sure I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to give you an Oscar.	You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.	What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?	I don't know.
Was it Albert?	Shouldn't think so.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?	Yeah.
Who set it up?  Eric?	Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.	Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?	Your brother? What you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now tell me the truth.	The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
And you didn't know her last name?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.	Nice of you to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry about your father.	Yeah.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?	They said he was drunk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's school?	I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?	Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right now?	Yeah.
You coming to South America?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going to live, then?	At me friend's house.
Where's that?	Wilton Estate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You work here, Keith?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you having, Jack?	Large Scotch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heard of a man called Thorpe?	Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you later.	Where you off to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.	Who's Brumby?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to you, then?	How'd you find me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won't be using the room tonight.	I see.
I'm staying with a friend.	Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.	It never is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ta.	I'll bet this one's seen some action.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?	Funny.  Can I phone London?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?	I'm sorry.
You don't look it.	No. Really, I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now just a minute...	Ta-ra.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sod.	They came back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'll they do to him?	Don't ask me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They bloody hurt me.	You're lucky. They kill as well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you sleep well?	Yes, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you tired?	No. Are you tired?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do us a favour?	What, and get myself beaten up again?
No chance of that.	Not much.
They're friends of mine.	And that'll make me feel better?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You coming back?	How could I stay away?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he?	Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.	What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?	No, I didn't know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?	No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.	It would be. If they were still living.
Meaning what?	A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.	That's all right, Eric.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.	Sod off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh? Have a drink.	Still got your sense of humour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gerald wants to see him first.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bollock naked with his socks still on?	They do that up North.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ask me?	Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not suede boots!	Knock it off, Gerald.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.	You're bluffing, you bastard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that? A hundred?	That's right, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right. Two hundred.	Ha.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four hundred?	That's right.
You're not seeing me?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll see you, then.	Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They did.	They killed the goose.
They did.	And now...
We're stuck with this...	We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...	It's too...
It is.	Eh?
It's too...	You get a bad month, all of a...
You're on this...	"All of, they got you on this ""board..."""
I, I...I...	Some contest board...
I...	It's not right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone should rob the office.	Huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Talking about it as a...
No.	As a robbery.
"As a ""robbery""?!  No."	Well.  Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going to steal the leads?	Have I said that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I say that?	Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?	What did he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A job with Graff.	Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.	He would take you on.  Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And why is that?	Because you listened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we get some coffee...?	How ya doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I, you know, they should be insured.	What do you care...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were the leads...	...what am I going to do all month...
<EOC>	<EOC>
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?	Was I?
Yes.	No.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?	No.
You have nothing to hide.	When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?	No, who?
Thieves.	Why?
They're inured to it.	You think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did the leads come in yet?	No.
Oh, God, I hate this job.	I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.	You...
That's great.	Thank you, George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wh...wh...Wha...?	We had a robbery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...how can you talk to me that... that...	Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who used to say that?	In school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	That they're going to be upset.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?	Excuse me, sir...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of what?	And what if you don't close.
I will close.	What if you don't close...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright.	And fifty bucks a lead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now?  Now?	Now.  Yes...When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Because I say so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Somebody broke in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.	That was easy, wasn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was his idea.	Was it?
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.	Uh-huh?
He told me my share was twenty-five.	Mmm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.	I'm sorry.
Why?	Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...	Fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did that?	Eighty-two thousand dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?	Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eight units?	That's right.
Shelly...!	Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...	They took the phones...
<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	Last night, this morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They took the leads?	Mmm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just now.	Guess who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you, Dave...	"""You have to believe in yourself... you""--look--""alright...?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you care...?	"""I want to tell you something, Harriet..."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?	Kenilworth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ricky, I...	Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I don't know.  Tell me.	To change our minds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.	It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?	I told you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on here?	Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.	You tell me again.
She wants her money back.	We're going to speak to her.
"No.  She told me ""right now."""	We'll speak to her, Jim...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...	I...
What...?	I...
What...?  Say the words.	I don't have the power.  I said it.
What power?	The power to negotiate.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?	This.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	And the check is...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are the police doing?	It's nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cashed the check?	Not to my knowledge, no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you.	Guess who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just this morning...	Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We haven't got a lead...	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They didn't get the contracts.	Did they...
They got, listen to me...	The...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen to me: They got some of them.	Some of them...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three?  I count two.	Three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see my present for you?	No, where is it?
On your pillow.	I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know.  How long will you be gone?	Just a few days.
Will you take me?	I can't.
Why do you have to go?	To do business.
I can help you.	Some day you will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your friend lives in a fine building.	Oh yes, the very best.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.	What?  You read it in the papers?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What took so long?	She couldn't decide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.	He's going to kill Fanucci.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to talk to you, Michael.	The children can stay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamn bitch.	Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's 'cent' Anne?'	A hundred years...it's a toast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to stay here...	Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready, Frankie.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Mike, what can I say?	Forget it, just go take care of her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.	Mio fratello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The 'patrone' is here.	Chi?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	She's gone, Tom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going to talk to him now.	Yes.
Will you tell him?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me too, Tom?	Yeah, give me a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you need anything, just...	Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on, tell me.	Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fifteen percent skim?	Twenty-five this time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It might show.	Mike wants it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I prefer to see my client privately.	The room has a bug in it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.	Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Senator Kane.	This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!	The committee is adjourned until further notice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kay.	Yes, Michael.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.	It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.	Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	When do we talk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll try.	It's important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On the phone?	No, she's here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rosato, where's your brother?	Sitting right behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I accept your generosity...	I won't keep you another minute...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This looks corny.	Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what did you think?	Weird.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you done with him?	I put him to bed.  He's not there?

Where to?	I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?	Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
<EOC>	<EOC>

What choice!!?	Either fight the way things are or accept it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.	Well, I am going to go after lunch.

He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise?	Promise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like that.	Would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lieutenant Bedsoe?	Not now.  I'm busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't see this.  Understand?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?	Yeah -- how'd you know that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Detective Bedsoe.	Lieutenant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you get back?	A few days ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was a good woman.	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.	Is that it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes -- I think it is.	Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The river.	That's all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Thomas.	For what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we doing here?	Living.  Remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
To ask her to dance.	She's the King's cousin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	What worries you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	It's done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go first.	No -- I will.
I stood up first.	That doesn't matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can go first.	No -- after you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It will be a good harvest this year.	Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?	I think you just like to eat dirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.	She's a treasure she is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How comes it your are not afraid?	Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We had a bargain.  You promised.	I lied.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I cannot stay.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leaving?  For how long?	You'll no see me again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.	Jennifer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you stare at me like that?	You remind me of someone I used to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't have any answers for you.	Who was that man last night?
I don't know.	Then how did he know your name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	You look like you have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening.	You're twenty minutes late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't answer my question.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm just trying to place you.	I've lived all over the world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.	And the other one -- he is like you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where will you go now?	It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?	He will not stop until it is over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's in there!	Get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful, Conner.	Conner?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're holding the workers down below.	Why?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.	What?  How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We found him this morning.	What's that next to him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stayed here again last night?	I was working on the cataloging.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.	I know, Paul.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.	This cannot be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am stronger than you, Highlander.	That's what the Kurgan said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It isn't over, is it, Conner?	No.
How can that be?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there anything else you need?	No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you care for some water, Conner?	Aye -- that I would, lass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't leave us, Conner.	It's not for me to decide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You kept it?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?	I think he's dead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Talley.	It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get anything on Smith?	Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!	I'm going to my desk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That woman's gonna call the cops.	Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.	I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's over.  We have to give up.	Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then we might as well die rich.	I'm not going to die for this!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who else is here?	My father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can take it with us.	You can't run with suitcases.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The cops are comin'!	I got the gasoline --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck is that?	They'll cut the power.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Donuts here any good?	I don't eat junk food.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you out of your mind?	You fucked up, Glen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we talk some more when you get here?	We'll see you in a couple of hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm scared shitless.	That's okay.  I love you anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow!  Shit!	Be quiet!  Listen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You leave that gun alone!	Shh, they'll hear you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	We can't make the microwave work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kevin left without you.	I don't know what you're talking about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now we can do whatever we want.	Stop it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please get away from me.	Mars?  What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the shirt.	Whatever.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.	He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are civilians inside?	He said something about a girl --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smith!  Wake up!	What are you doing?!  Stop that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's enough.	Another minute.  Please --
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not enough.	What's that, Chief?  Say again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Louise?	Go, Chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let it go, Captain.	Goddamned small town bullshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's mine.  Talley.	Chief, it's Mikkelson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The kids are in here!	Where's the office?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you open them?	I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are the disks still in your room?	No!  They're right here --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are my children?	They're still in the house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your gun?	I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?	What do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul, Paul, a moment please.	Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?	I'm sorry, it's a private function.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul!	Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.	I'll be back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this about?	Let me see your identity card.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.	Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?	No. I work at the Mille Collines.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.	Let me explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, I don't use guns.	There is nothing to it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten.	And four children?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul, you know who this is?	Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything. Strong.	Canadian Club?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.	You said you had no whiskey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must go to the Diplomat.	Get in.
Your police are at the gate?	After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are better here.	Listen, you need me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.	Business is good at the hotel?
Very good.	I am always glad to see you Paul.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	Take the river road back. It is clear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit! Holy shit.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fucking see that!	Oh my God!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, have a sandwich.	Fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great, I really need a shower.	Just give me a moment to get your keys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The fifth room is your broadcast room.	Good. I'd like to book a massage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are no more rooms.	Give me the phone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Manager.	Gregoire, what are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going, sir?	For supplies, you drive.
The fog is too heavy, sir.	Just drive, Gregoire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure this is the river road?	I saw the sign.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul, how the hell are ya'?	I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
They moved you from the Diplomat?	Promoted. House Manager.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perfect timing.	This goes out live?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who did you call?	Call, sir?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?	Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.	He will be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.	They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I will need a suite.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thomas wants advice?	He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.	Homework?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	We must do something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The president has been murdered.	Murdered! By whom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are Thomas and Fedens?	I sent them home. Go and call them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, Paul, 'til first light.	Dawn. Then they go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God!	Where are you hurt, son?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, Paul.	Stay with the children.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul, don't let them die.	Get in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This won't do.	It will do just fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any luck?	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They are being evacuated.	What about us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go to the roof now.	What for Paul.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	We're running out of beer and other supplies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to stay.	No! Sit down now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me go. Children get off.	I will follow on the next plane. Go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you. Keep the children safe.	Paul! Then another voice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are almost out of water.	We are almost out of everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my babies.	Anais, it is so good to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twelve are dead.	How dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?	He has taken the presidential suite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	The lieutenant wants the register.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where has all our beer gone?	Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
How much beer?	Many beers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?	When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this about no water?	It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul, are you there?	Yes, thank you Mr. President.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are soldiers.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moses, Moses Seradungu.	Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.	What is his room number?
I don't know.	Go downstairs, I will help you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.	Not at all!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus H. Christ!	Oh dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like we're it.	More to the point. Where's our host?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.	Yeah...something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't think it'll be a problem.	C'mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Melissa!	Ms. Marr!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Is she alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it??	I don't know!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.	As a tumor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This thing's going nowhere.	If this is someone's idea of a joke --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.	Yeah, me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- I did: down here.	And I think that's case --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?	You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's in there?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! Where'd you guys go?	Left, goddamnit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's down there?	The...Fourth of July.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Jesus.	Poor Mr. Price --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhhhh...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you know where it is, get there!	Me? You've gotta be kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pritchett, is that you?	Up here --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pritchett!	Over here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll meet you down there.	Take the gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- the stained glass --	-- yeah, we did that --
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- closed.	Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is she...alright?	I thought she was dead. For sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	Most fun I've had all day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hear somebody?	No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was upstairs with Eddie --	-- that's the fact, bud --
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- you lose either way, Price --	-- listen to the man --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good point.	Let's try down here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cheery looking bunch.	Better living through electricity.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or an on-line computer.	That's crazy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is the best we're gonna do.	It'll have to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Price!!	He's gotta still be down here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay, everything's okay now.	He's dead...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't think it's even an issue.	We're safe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What --	-- was that??
<EOC>	<EOC>
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!	For chrissake give me a hand!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. It's just trying to frighten us.	It's succeeding!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did it go?	Run.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Jesus H. Christ.	So where's the party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could we have a word?	Oh, I think we're going to have several.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- just not always in the sexual sense.	You're hurting me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!	Steven??
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.	Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.	You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --	-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think this is fucking funny??	No, no, it's just --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?	Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do something!	Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please! Something! Oh-God!	Maybe if I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think...I may have the answer.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vannacutt!!	Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was right! Pritchett was right!	I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	Good way to get your head blown off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it??	Something with the power, I don't know!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.	I think I'll do what I damn well please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was upstairs!	I never saw you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- listen to me, goddamnit --	-- no more --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then tell me, please -- help me...!	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.	Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Problem where? Looked good to me.	"""Dummy 6"" keeps losing his arm."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wish I could take the credit, but --	-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no.	What's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't know that it does.	Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Won't do any good.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?	Blackburn's dead.
Excuse me?	He would have been back by now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Price!	Oh, dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pritchett: what is going on?	He must've unsealed the room!
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- hey! --	-- ten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Eddie!!	Over here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please.....anyone....help me?	Melissa...?
For the love of God....please...?	Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Sara...?	Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --	-- I'm coming --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...	You say you saw some activity here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn it.	What's the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They don't build them like this anymore.	Suppose not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Town records are coming up now.	What will they tell you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks delicious...	Why don't you pass me your plate?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you find her?!	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	A few years older, perhaps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It will heal.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-bye.	Good-bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.	Well I bet you they're happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I do it again tonight?	We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't play games with me, little girl.	I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!	Maybe it was Colleen...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's going to hurt us!	No it won't - no it won't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you talk to her?	She talks to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's down...	She's down...how do you mean honey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!	Ok...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My angel!	I'm scared!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we leaving mommy?	Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going to go, mommy?	We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?	We'll get it later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
H-how long will it take?	Go to your room!  Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your father doesn't love us anymore!	What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She says she's lonely...	Where is she?
She's here.	Where is she now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's down.  Help her...	Take me to her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me!  Please!!!	My God, I heard something!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he doing daddy?	He's blessing the house.
Why?	For good luck honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look daddy!  It's empty!	That's great, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy please help me!	Don't be afraid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God!  She's in there!	Daddy help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we going back to California daddy?	Well, that all depends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night Angel...	Good night daddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just going to take a while.	Whatever you say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To our family.	To our family.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you playing tricks on me?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that?	I don't know.  That's strange.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...set up some more things.	Ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	It was in the cellar.  Weird.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But do you agree with me?	Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It just disappeared.  Literally.	I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa there...	Are you ok?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are we doing?	I think everything's ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God where is she!	She's gone!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aubrey!	Aubrey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm fine.	Ok...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't think I know?	Know what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maura, what is this!	We're not going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!	No...  NO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maura!	What's happening!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	I'm ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're bleeding.	I'm all right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.	Maura.
Maura.	Yeah, they told us this was the best.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.	You'll have to settle for turkey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?	White meat will be fine...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must be a Londrigan.	Yes, I am.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What...amulet?	Did you remove anything in the cellar!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long will it take!	It will not take long...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you mind if I borrow it?	Not at all, if it can help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something in there.	What?
There's something through that wall!	Well what is it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wha .... ?	The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was off the statue.  In the club.	What happened to him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!	Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?	I'm trying to quit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.	It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll boil some water.	I'll do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How have you ... ?	Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?	Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terri?	Buying some drugs, alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What am I looking for?	God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes really.	Wow.  Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?	Unh-unh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.	Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see, we're not so dissimilar.	But how in God's name ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do we start?	It has already begun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was beautiful.	I laughed, I cried.

It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....	Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.	Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cameras?	No need.  Guards' station's right there.

She isn't!	She is!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's good, Bennie.	She's damn good, Lou.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, miss.	Thank you for waking me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you need some help.	I'm afraid so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Rand...	You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.	I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're single?	Yes.
Where were you trained?	At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.	It'll wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But don't you have to work?	By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.	Did you hear what he sang?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?	Of course, Wes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have the servants made you comfortable?	Yes, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard someone crying -- a woman --	A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A mental case?	I'm sorry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Miss Connell.	Good morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.	I imagined this so differently...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.	Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?	No thank you. We should be off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night.	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Halfords have invited us again this year.	You want to go?
What do you think?	Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm, uh, going to bed.	So early?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?	Hmm. Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.	I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...	You know Elena, I've been thinking--
<EOC>	<EOC>
The turkey in?	Stuffed and baking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dinner in ten minutes.	You go dry off now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's for dessert?	See for yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've...	In the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready to go?	We're not going anywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?	Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --	The phone's out.
Yeah. Well, we can just --	Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you.	Stay out of trouble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	Birth control.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-night dad.	Good night kiddo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you kids doing down here?	What do you think we're doing, dad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your toes cold?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.	C'mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But...	But what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you Janey.	It was lovely!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah. You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi mom.	Hi Wendy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw you on your bike today.	With Mikey?
Who?	Nobody.
Mikey Williams?	We were just riding around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like coffee.	It'll warm you up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't.	It's not a bother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.	It's really quite all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you are.	Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.	Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	Moisture! Moisture!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.	Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Awesome sleet and rain.	Major.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.	Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frankie opens them with his teeth.	Hey, it's a sellable skill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe you should have just a half.	Thanks for the advice dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?	Who said so?
No one.	I don't have a girlfriend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mikey?	Yeah?
Geometry?	Sure, anything but this English.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want some gum?	Sure.  Twinkie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you tell Sandy?	Tell Sandy? What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't ever want to see you.	Then why'd you come after me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to follow me?	I dunno. I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow!	Wendy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
When worlds collide.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Charles.	Greetings, Charles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Wendy.	Hey Sandy.
Mikey was looking for you.	Yeah? See ya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a drink?	Vodka?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It feels warm.	One more shot?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	That's all, for now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't want to miss anything.	Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Good.	Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just after Leland Street.	What's that, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So far.	What's the D.A. got them on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will, you can't blame yourself.	I had him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to get back.	Too bad...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My partner...	Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did your homework, Officer.	Actually...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.	Don't worry about him...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.	But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you to check this out, Ellie.	We already did.
Do it again.	But there wasn't any...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This murder was in the papers, right?	Yeah.  All over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She your only sibling?	Twelve years younger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's legitimate.	Worth pursuing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about your shoulder?	Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry about...	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're sure it's hers?	Has her books in it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	I told her to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll call him now.	First I need a copy of the key.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget your pager?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.	And something else that might interest you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Randy Stetz?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eight years.	Seven years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want to talk about?	You know what about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.	What are we thinking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like the natives are restless.	Will?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your friend's all business.	I'm always all business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will...I...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you love her?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	You don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thought I smelled something.	Good to see you, too, Randy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never met anyone from Seattle before.	You're not missing much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to take you somewhere?	Long as it's fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey...	Thought you wanted something fun...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You and Kay were like sisters?	That's what I said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...	Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!	But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
<EOC>	<EOC>
No game.	The phone call.  The knapsack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Down at the station?	Yes down at the station.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was only seventeen.	But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.	Did you have sex with her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	But you wanted to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gave her gifts.	Yes.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.	Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.	I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about him?	He.  Well, he...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Randy Stetz is in jail.	Told you I could write an ending.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought maybe we could talk some more.	There's nothing more to talk about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you that was an accident!	Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.	I didn't want to kill her, Will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.  Like that.	This an accident, Walter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your back-up?	No back-up.
You're not following procedure.	Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wild card.	Drop the gun, Walter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you have the answers...	Ah! You have questions?
What are we?	Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?	Surely you know the one who made you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is a picture, nothing more.	You mean we are not children of Satan?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was waiting for you...	Listen to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Stop her Louis!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?	No. Laudanum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't Louis --	Louis, put me in my coffin...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want more.	What have you done?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you learn to write, Claudia?	The way I learn everything. By watching you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claudia! You did that?	Sit still. It's not finished -
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to be a doll forever?	Claudia - don't -
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're immortal. You've always known that.	Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.	Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Louis, look at me.	I can't. Go away from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It can't be -	It is! Take the back stairwell -
<EOC>	<EOC>
The ship is sailing wihout us!	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do I look?	Still my beautiful child.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.	You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's no vampire.	No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is no performance.	And no one knows but us...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is monstrous!	Yes, and very beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!	Be still!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He can protect us, Claudia.	You really believe that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They would have killed you -	Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not afraid of anything, are you?	Why should I be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really want to be with them?	Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I hear a yes?	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're sure?	Sure...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come, you're going to feed now.	I want a woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take him.	The crucifix -
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have I done?	You have fed. You were made for this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dear God, what have I done?	You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The girl, Lestat -	I know. Let her alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unless I make her one of us...	NO!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's here, your wounded one.	What are you saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No... You come back to me Louis...	Are you mad????
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.	Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to go now Lestat...	You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we go on?	He did it to make you stay with him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promise to care for her then?	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And the child who did die?	My daughter...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can I do for you?	Checking in...Karla Wilson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in 201 and 202.	Is that bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen to me. He's here.	Who? Who is here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.	Phones went down a few minutes ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stupid. Stupid.	Stupid. What were you thinkng?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.	Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's nothing between Will and me.	Yet. Nothing yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?	Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm the King of the World.	No, I'm the King of the World.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello? Hello?	Where is everyone? I'll ask --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.	Karla! You promised.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karaoke -- perfect.	Don't even think about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way.	Yes.
No.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get any sleep at all?	Some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karla!	Just kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let him go. I believe him.	Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful, Julie.	I've got to see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no way to lock it.	What do we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know...	Come on, you can make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julie?	I'm right here. Grab my hand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm holding your hand!	No, you're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, god, it's you --	You're okay. Thank god.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ray, I can't...	Can't what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love it here.	It's gonna be great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Checking the locks again?	You know me to well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.	Fine. Show me the body.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Voodoo.	I told you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't kill me --	Wait, it's Nancy --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julie! Wait! You okay?	I'm fine.
You sure?	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This was not my idea.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure it's okay with you?	Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julie? What's wrong?	It's...him.
What do you mean, Julie?	He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.	It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What are you talking about? Where?	It's in my room!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. We're gonna be okay.	Did you get help?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.	He's in it with Willis?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there a problem here?	Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oooh, the mainland --	Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess the capital of Brazil --	Rio, baby!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.	We gotta get out of here. Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think that's a good place to hide?	I don't know, but I'm starving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To a great weekend --	Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ahh, that feels great.	How's Julie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why? He can't help us.	He's probably the only one who can help us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?	Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rio de Janeiro!	Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeez, that's a full carat --	How much?
Well, there's some flaws in her...	How much?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys lost?	Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, boy trouble?	Not anymore.
He leave you?	No. I shot him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Cool.	The rest of us see bathrobes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.	Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.	So why are you still here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take this.	And do what with it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They were cut loose.	Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll only be a second, okay?	Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd Estes go?	What is up with that weirdo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is Miss Wollsten?	She's in her room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We will see who is the first to die.	Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
) You feel the symptoms?	My friend -- what can one say --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.	I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Oliver.	Sleep well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not leaving tomorrow..?	I think not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!	Poor Cathy --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I was looking for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are fortunate in your father.	Thea is an orphan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have forgotten it, dear.	My last name is Pherides.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I felt he did not like me.	That should decide it or you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
It makes me fear her.	I can't understand that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Theodosia --	Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're crying. Why?	I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --	You see? Thea believes it, too!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.	Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But they're somebody's children.	Are you running a business or a charity ward?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?	Don't . . . George?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you say?	I said I wish I'd never been born.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.	You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	No wonder you jumped in the river.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.	Made what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Zuzu's petals.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clarence . . .	Yes, George?
Where's Mary?	Oh, well, I can't . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's . . .	Where is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!	I know. I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Ernie!	Hiya, George!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this the place?	Of course it's the place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.	Joseph, now show him what happened today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	Mother . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Daddy.	Well, what happened to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?	Want to give my flower a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.	Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There it is, good as new.	Give the flower a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hee-haw!	Hee-haw!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.	Goodbye, Sam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What boat you sailing on?	I'm working across on a cattle boat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, everybody!	All in . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.	I'm all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George! George!	Yes, sir.
You're not paid to be a canary.	No, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it a charge, sir?	Yes  charge.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .	Aw, get going!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a martini?	No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?	Okay.  What's yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got a match?	Very funny. Very funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, George, how are you?	Harry . . . Harry . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
George.	Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Do me a favor, will you, George?	What's that?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?	Oh, yeah, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two cents worth of shoelaces?	She was here first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, George . . .	Hello, Violet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.	Hello, Vi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What gives?	Nothing.
Where are you going?	Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say hello to New York for me.	Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?	Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.	It's important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	How do you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?	George . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.	Hello?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those Rockefellers!	Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pop!	They're not my children.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.	You like it? I'll send you a box.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	Have you notified the police?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Made up your mind yet?	I'll take chocolate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
With coconuts?	I don't like coconuts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not very good at this.	Neither am I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hot dog! Just like an organ.	Beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.	You may kiss my hand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch!	Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.	I'm going to scream!
<EOC>	<EOC>
After that, who cares?	That does it  come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .	Please, let's not stop, George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have fun.	Thanks for dropping around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it snowing?	Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?	Left them at the office.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where're you going?	Going up to see Zuzu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary! Mary!	George, darling! Where have you been?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, George, George, George.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Oh, George, George!	You have no idea what's happened to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about that one there?	Hmm? Well, I . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
How fast does this go?	With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can?	You going to the lighthouse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, you guys.	Well, I don't know....
<EOC>	<EOC>
For me...?	What the hell.  For you....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great!  Find one for me.	With butter, if they got any....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wheee!  Faster!	How fast is enough?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My hair's getting wet!	So's mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When do we get to the lighthouse?	Soon, dark eyes, soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't wait to get there.	But of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure you do -- you win either way.	I'm supposed to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, shit.	Someone pop your balloon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.	What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay, it's okay....	Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't!	Stop paddling!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!	Back down!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get on the rocks!	Swim for it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, it's her job.	Is she responsible for the punch?
No.	Good.  It's terrible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.	I hope that's the cousin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe by now they are.	They're moving pretty fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Shut up.	Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Turkeys!  Eat wind!	Yee-hah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your dad must be really pissed.	We better go back in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Putz -- that won't be for hours.	I was counting on hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.	Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why'd they decide to move?	Too hot in the lighthouse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	We're hung up on something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where're we going?	Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But the island!	The Shark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're carrying weight.	We'll take your supercargo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coming up!  Give way!	Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Loser sails home alone.	You're betting what you already got.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Throw it.	Sean!  Catch it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	What the hell, we're steering for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coming up!	Gangway, Turkies!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you said she was going with us?	Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?	Want to swim home?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You coming up on him?	You bet.  Hang on....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	Over here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sean!   Catch the rope!	The rope!  The rope!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're hung up here.  Snagged.	Can you get us a line?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?	Oh, yeah.  Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning!	Aren't you off-duty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
On your own time?	Happy to do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got a helluva tide this month.	Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about that camera?	What camera?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't let you take her out.	You can't stop me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Untie that rope.	Please.  It's my job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're too close.  Back off.	Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going out there.	Hey -- you can't do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where to?	No place special.  Just hanging out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stay here a minute.	Oh, c'mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Hooper coming to dinner?	Not till next year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike?  Is that you?	Pop.  I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I passed out, but I'm okay.	At least you're safe.  What about the others?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, I'm sorry....	Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have this dance?	Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute....	Too late, it's written.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at that:	First things first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell were you?	Late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I have to talk to those two?	My boss and your boss.  Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?	And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen -- what are you doing later?	Fooling around?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get the kid home.	Home it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmm.	MMMmmmorning....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sean's awake.	Door's locked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Silvera?	Mrs. Silvera.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need a ride?	As far as the office.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  That's my boss!	Better yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to smoke so early in the morning?	It's good with coffee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eat Cheerios.	What're you guys doing today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's my day book?	In the den.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing?	Going out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?  What's the matter?	Mike's out there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.	Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?	Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.	Shouldn't he be at home?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I go swimming?	No.  Find your brother, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some people.	What's daddy doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I go with you today?	You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Dad.	Hiya yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hang on!	Dad!  Dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They made me go with them.	Sure they did....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that me?	That's you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.	Now I really want to see it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It killed her.  It ate her.	Shh.  Shhh....
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to die.	It's all right, we're okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old is your cousin?	Seventeen.  She's a senior.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My cousin will be here tomorrow.	Great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going out right away, are you?	Waiting for Andy.
I want you to meet my cousin.	I will, I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike!  Are you going out?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terry!  You okay?	Help!  Help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyone know what time it is?	3:30.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The wind drift is lateral.	What's that mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take a break for a minute, okay?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on back up here!	Nope.
Give me back my hat!	Double nope!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful....	Anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.	Figure they split?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much longer?	Until we find something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About damn time.	What the hell is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Power line.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll be over by the lighthouse.	I'll be right there.  Wait up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were grounded.	I can go out if I want to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!	Name it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't care.	I love it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faster!  Faster!	Coming about....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heading back?	Might as well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's got to help or it won't work.	Sean, baby, please....
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think she's such hot stuff.	When are we going out?  You and me?
Not tonight.	You going with Patrick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who wouldn't.	Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're turning around.	Coming about, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't need you.  Andy's here.	You always go with Andy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I have to play with the little kids?	Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want Fruit Loops!	Eat Cheerios.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going out.	Yeah.
You're going sailing.	Maybe.
Take me.	No.
I want to go with you!	Quiet!  Shhh!
Michael....	Okay, okay.  Close your door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Would you take him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we got a couple of live ones.	Brody's riding his tower.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God....	What the hell is he doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be reasonable, please....	Forget it, he won't listen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't feel bad.	Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Miller time!	You buying?
Sure am.	Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see the three-quarter socket?	Yeah.  Down there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Want another one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, not much longer to go.	What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.	Hope I make it through both.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.	They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.	I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the rubber band?	Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do now?	Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.	Just put your mask on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey... you all right?	No.
Are you scared?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn it!	Hi, baby.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!	They just wanted to say hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael...	It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going down there again?	Yes.
After what happened to us?	I know I can capture it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kathryn...	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Change your mind?	No.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.	No, you're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can use a shot of what he's got.	... Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to stay?	Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finally.	How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.	Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmm... you smell good.	You don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.	... He ought to put him in here.
It's too soon to move him.	So tell Calvin.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.	Well, that's why you got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody better get down there!	It's all controlled from the Control Room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on!	You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right.	Who's going to do it?
Me.	Michael, you're not going down there.
I am.  You're not.	But you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael, you don't have to go down there.	I want that shark, Kathryn.
You don't have to prove anything.	Only to myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	I'm  fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.	Make this quick!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I will.	Well, then I'm going to film it.

Hi, Mike.	How you doing, Kelly?

Well, I needed a cold shower.	Come on!  Check this out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where to be.  High and dry.	And alone.

How was your trip? Profitable?	We'll be broke in four weeks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Absolutely not.	They're here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it a rex?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How would you classify it?	Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.	Baryonyx?
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.	I don't remember that on InGen's list.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ALAN!	KEEP GOING!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I CAN GET HIM!	NO!

<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything good?	Raptors, mostly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eric, your parents are both here.	In Costa Rica?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any kids?	No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bonitas.	Something must've scared them.

It's strikes me now I never told her that.	You should.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're safe!	No we're not.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Amanda!	Back out! Move!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Billy!	It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

If I don't move, I can't shoot it.	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he got in there?	Piss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Their what?	Oh, God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know how to work a radio, don't you?	You're going too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's gutty.	She's nuts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way.	Oh, my God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you see any family resemblance here?	You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then this is our chance.	Our chance to do what?

You killed him.	Oh, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.	We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.

You're a beautiful woman.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It seems like we're getting lower.	It happens when I land.
Why are we landing?	'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go!!!	<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.	No!!  Out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was he a good man?	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	It came from across the lake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he?!	I don't know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.	Bastard bit my chopper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--	'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got something on the screen.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he?	Tranq guns down, rifles up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Such the flirt.	U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was an Indo-pacific.	Are you sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Jack</u>!	I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Could we have intercourse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm okay.	You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're gonna be okay.	Guess I finally got bit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gonna live?	Yeah.  Thanks to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kelly Scott.	Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It really is beautiful, isn't it?	Never been to Maine before?
<EOC>	<EOC>
In Maine?	There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Same thing from Fish And Game.	<u>Something's</u> in that water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was an awful thing to say to me.	I'm sorry but you're...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  We're up at six.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?  Kelly?	Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.	That's probably good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Are</u> you okay?	Um... y'know...  Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the... bandaid.	Night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well.  Goodnight.	We seem to say goodnight a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thing we can lift it?	Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.	You're mushing it a little around the--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.	<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Really--	<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Calm down.	You calm down!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we crazy?	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's mooing.	You wouldn't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch out!!	Keep firing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hector!!	Take him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's through fighting.  Look at him.	I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get him onto shore.	He heeds a tourniquet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...	You wanna ride in my truck?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If I'm ever in New York...	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...	But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was... something meeting you.	Likewise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm ready when you are.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Half mile up, there's a clearing.	You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	White perch.
Are they feeding?	Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said nobody came in here!	Obviously I was wrong!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I'm gonna puke.	<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!	Where is he?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you get a safe shot...	I'll take it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for your help.	You too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This... how long did this attack go on for?	Seconds.  Three, four.
And this is how he came to the boat?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're sort of a rude person.	It's just that--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I thought I saw...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!!	You threw it at me!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?	I asked you to be nice to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hank?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hank!	He said he knew Karate!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.	Look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get him?	I don't know.  Back the truck--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I?	Wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kelly.	Kevin, hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had a great time last night. Again.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?	Never cock. Just squeeze.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd I do?	"Stay cool. Just remember to call him ""God."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.	Thanks, Ardelia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, is that smart...	Why does she keep repeating the name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. He won't come after me.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""- every day."""	Hot damn, Clarice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agent Starling! Telephone!	Agent Mapp! Thank you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...	Sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Miss Starling?	Okay, Mr. Yow...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?	That wasn't me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?	I think we may be, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard a strange sound...	What was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Starling.	Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...?	Did you breast-feed her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time, Pilch! My move.	No fair! You lured him with produce.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course it counts. How do you play?	Officer Starling. Welcome back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	Can we rest soon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Ottawa are gone.	Why did they turn back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr Poe?	Miss.  May I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?	Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we safe?	Maybe...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And my compliments to you...	Alice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you go back to England?	I have nothing to go back for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you consider that?	Yes. Yes, I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, Alice.	It can be dangerous...
<EOC>	<EOC>
One called Magua arrived.	He delivered no such message.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see...	I am sorry, Duncan...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. Go ahead.	What the bloody hell plan is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!	Do not let gratitude get in the way...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who were these people?	Ottawa!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any powder?	: Only one or two loads.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.	You're not coming with us?

You mind if I take a look at this?	Be my guest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.	I'm not a doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?	Intelligence may not be the right word...
<EOC>	<EOC>
DeJesus!  A readout!	He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doc eat already?	The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Your suit, Becky!	Just get in yours!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need more light on that, Four.	Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.	You screw around like that again and--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sixpack?	Why can't we pick up his signal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!  He sent them all.	The escape bubbles?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Seeing how my stock's doing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We made it!	Where's Jones?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It hit me!  Where are they?!	I can't see them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The internal monitors read normal.	Where's Doc?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something wrong, Cobb?	Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What's wrong with it?	...I'd really have to show it to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, sir...	Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	It bit me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going inside.	What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...	Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me a readout, DeJesus.	Ahhhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel, DeJesus?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?	Beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forty-eight hours!	I realize you must have gone through hell--

<EOC>	<EOC>
So that's all you do?...	Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?	Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...	I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!	I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?	It's had a meal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It would explain the suction- like appendages.	Like a leech.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...	No fuckin' lie...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clear for pickup.	Let's hope it holds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What on earth's the matter with you?	I ought to smack your face!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	DeJesus...It's got him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...	Oh man, that's just great...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	The good doctor signed our death warrant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	The air's stopped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't spend all day down there.	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't believe me.	He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's good.	You haven't seen anything yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They were jealous of him.	Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-	You didn't marry him for love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Christ.	Why don't you tell me the truth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay.	No it isn't.  You can't help me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing's going to happen to you.	Nothing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was so afraid.	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Are you sure?	I'm sure.  He's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harry?	It's all right.  It's not hurting...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God!	Hang on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got to help him.	You can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  No!  No!	Harry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
... oh... God...	I'm here, Harry.
...yes?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't look.	I... have... to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harry?	I'm okay.  I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it finished?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck?	Harry-?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Valentin?	Good.  There.  Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.	No word from D'Amour?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the fuck is he?	He got up and walked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And this Butterfield guy--	--vanished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You believe that?	I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They weren't worth a damn.	I heard he was the best.
<EOC>	<EOC>
With what?	Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?	Fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whose is the car?	Mine.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.	Maybe I just bought it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any movie stars buried here?	Probably.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.	I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?	Are you a believer, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is she?	Swann's wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to speak to Dorothea.	I'm afraid she's not in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't let you in.	Yeah, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave her alone --	Shut up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you satisfied now?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
D'Amour --	Shit...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Him too.	We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.	Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...	What about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they all in the business?	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, Ma, no wires.	You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?	Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.	Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Jeez.	Will that do?  No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did she know where Nix was buried?	No.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They got here before us.	Looks that way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... no...	He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!	You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's where we're all going.	In my time, and nobody else's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?	At a guess... they just resurrected him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where we killed him.	You didn't try hard enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He did something with the ground.	Yes?
Can you do it?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not!  He's not!	Who's not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nix! Nix!	Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!	And he's dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Swann?  What are you doing?	Binding you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could still help me do that.	Why would I want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.	Not true.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are having a mid-life crisis.	I know, it's stupid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.	Hi, Charlie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you feel like singing, Bob?	No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to go home.	I know. I don't either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?	Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course.	Do you want to have some breakfast?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey look, it's Sausalito.	I see them every morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I scowl at you?	No, you smiled.
I don't remember.	I know, I kind of blend in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.	I know, but that's what you like about me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's for my daughter.	How old is she?
Four.	Oh, she'll love it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice one.	Fuck off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's bad isn't it?	We should get you to the doctor.
You think so?	Yeah, look at that thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your husband?	Working.
Do you ever see him?	Yeah.
Do you know where we are?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.	I don't want to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want to drink?	A coke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, where'd you go today.	Around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	That lunch was the worst, huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When are you leaving?	Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.	That's what you said the other night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlotte?	Hi, Bob.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?	Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?	Yes, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're leaving right now?	Yes.
Well... have a good flight.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you crying?	I'll miss you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Harris?	Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.	Oh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Harris?	Yes?
Do you like massage?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My stockings.	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hello, Bob, it's me.
Hello?	It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?	Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.	Do you want to-
What?	Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Yeah.	Zoe, come say hello to your father...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess she's busy.	That's ok.
When are you coming home?	Tomorrow.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.	Ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Ok.	Do you want I send it to your room?
Great.	Thank you, Mr. Harris.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"How do you say ""hospital"" in Japanese?"	Excuse me?
Hospital?	One moment, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello? Yes?	Hello, can I have room 5601.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evelyn Waugh?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd it go today?	Good...I'm tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what to do.	That's ok, you'll figure it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You smell weird.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like popcorn?	I got some hair stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hair stuff?	I gotta go to work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you later.	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think it's done?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, the record company sent these...	Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure you want to stay?	Are you sure you have to go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I miss you.	It'll just be a few days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lauren?	Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John! What are you doing here?	I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I missed you.	Do you think they have a room here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never said anything to me...	It's probably trivial.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?  That's horrible!	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.	When did they find her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm still shaking.	I can't believe Will killed him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're these?	I don't know.  What are they?
I found them in your file box.	Must be a spare set.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a...jerk!	Peter, are you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...you wearing a watch, Father?	Yes.  It's exactly...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he going to be okay?	I hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.	You ready?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.	Just open the door, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So...we won?	Yes.  We won, that's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, please don't die.	...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two negatives always make a positive.	Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what'd I miss?	You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need to talk.	Peter, please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We needed to know all we could.	I'm going to look around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get up!!	What's the...OH SHIT!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter, let go of the chair!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	When's your birthday?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.	That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's nothing else here.	What's the bible for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm scared I'm slipping back.	We're going to do this.
You have to say that.	That's true.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was trying to tell me something.	"And his message was  ""Together, no matter what?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much time do we have?	Not a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Peter.	It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good seeing you again.	Whish the circumstances were different.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't want to face it.	Look, John, I'm facing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.	You are the younger of two...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	It's Detective Smythe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good of you to stop by.	We millionaires yet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you sign it for me?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter with you?	He's looking right at me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He could see me.	I'll quit, maybe you should start.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Monica, what did you do?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Taste this.	I can't eat before a game.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Nothing.  So good luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Need any help?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one for tomorrow?	The blue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	Thanks, sweetheart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can take it.	This time get your feet set.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I take your coat?	You're cold?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I mean I can check it for you.	Oh, sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm an English major.  You like English?	Sort of.
Careful.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My mouth is kinda dry.	Then I'll get you some punch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was nice.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait...	Shh.  It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It means a lot that you came by.	Yes, we appreciate that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn, girl.	What?
I don't wanna see that.	Get used to it, babe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how long is this trip?	Four days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That too tight?	No.
Mom's going to hate it.	Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.	Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever been in love?	Too many times.
They ever love you back?	Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shoot like a girl.	I'll take that as a compliment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coach hates me, doesn't she?	She hates all freshmen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	Just one word of advice for next season.
What's that?	Never let a freshman take your spot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what do you know.	What's up, Sidra.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.	"How do you say ""you're dreaming"" in Italian?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you take that damn thing off the table.	You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One, up.	Lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we gotta kiss now.	For how long?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to ride my own bike.	My Dad always drives my Mom.
So?	So that means I have to ride with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't have to do what you say.	Man, forget you then, stupid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Way to hoop.	I know this.  What do you want?
A ride home.	Your legs don't look broke.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.	"Guess ""please"" would be a stretch."
<EOC>	<EOC>
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.	Who said I'm not getting recruited?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not the one who put this scar here.	God, here we go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you made it.	Yeah.
You don't look half-bad.	You either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that about?	I know, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You do see me standing here, right?
I can't be nice to a fan?	Fine, Quincy.
I can't help girls coming up to me.	I said fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay, little baby.	Quit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how about a little one-on-one?	What are we playing for?
Clothes.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me the ball.	My court, I go first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kiss my booty.	Plan to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Yo, where's the ""D""?"	Right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won.	I wanted you to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.	I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.	Quincy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.	Here I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry about your game.	It happens, right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that?	Nobody.
Who's nobody?	Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
You want to go talk?	Not really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.	Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.	"The ""man"" again."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.	What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.	Are you out of your mind?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So...I guess I'll see you around.	Uh huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just something I'm trying.	No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.	Find.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	We need to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You asked me what was missing.	What?
From basketball.	you woke me up to tell me that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll play you.	What?
One game.  One-on-one.	For what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, girl.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give it yourself.	I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zeke.	"What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say ""shit."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine, then how many nights home is that?	Keep your voice down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not great.	What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.	Nona, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	We still have to go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was your game?	Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Still the man.	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your dad?	Said he'd be home later.
Later when?	I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You scared me.	Sorry.  You okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?	"""Can't"" should never be in a man's vocabulary."
Why not?	Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What surery?	Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Will...?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
There's somebody in the house, Jack...	Wait for the back-up! Will?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell's Graham!	He went to the men's room.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is he saying these things?!	They're gonna lynch him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!	Why isn't he MOVING??
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll need a search running.	It's already begun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know.	Know what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The sewers.  Of course.	Hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.	And you are?
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.	You all look the same to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gonna make it.	No way.  Not possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weird.	What?
That's the third white van I've seen.	Should Tank I.D. it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Oh, God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's Choi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're two hours late.	I know.  It's her fault.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got the money?	Two grand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You weren't supposed to relieve me.	I know but I felt like taking a shift.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear that?	Hear what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure this line is clean?	Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Trinity.	Cypher?  Where's Tank?
He had an accident.	An accident?!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!	He's going to pop!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that...?	The Matrix?  Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why you're here?	... Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks... for the drink.	Any time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Operator.	I need an exit!  Fast!
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right --	Go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got a fibrillation!	Shit!  Apoc?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me your phone.	They'll be able to track it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is he doing?	He's beginning to believe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long?	Five minutes.  Maybe six.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy fucking shit!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The cubicle across from you is empty.	But what if...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you still want to meet?	... Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... am I dead?	Far from it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do my eyes hurt?	You've never used them before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right now, we're inside a computer program?	Wild, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.	For what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.	Show me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did I beat you?	You -- you're too fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know why you didn't make it?	Because... I didn't think I would?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought it wasn't real.	Your mind makes it real.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Set down in there.	What's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is he?	Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it.	I need the main wet-wall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now left and that's it in front of you.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tank, charge the E.M.P.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to make the call.	Do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How...?!	He is the One.  He is the One!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That vase.	Shit, I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is this?!	It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From what?	From you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Neo, please, you have to trust me.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this thing?	We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-oh...	It's going into replication.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get this thing out of me!	Easy, Neo.  Easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does that mean?	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
But an Oracle can.	That's different.
Is it?	Are you worried?
Should I be?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you go to her?	Yes.
What did she tell you?	She told me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	... right as rain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go!	We can't leave him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Morpheus alive?	Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I don't know.  It just went dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!	There has to be something that we can do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That I would have to make a choice...	What choice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I believe I can bring him back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No one has ever done anything like this.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you fly that thing.	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning.  Did you sleep?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit!	Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See who?	The Oracle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Operator.	Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way?  Which way?	Duck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's locked.	Kick it in!  Kick it in!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Operator.	Tank, it's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tank, you're hurt.	I'll be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is.  We have to pull the plug.	You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Neo!	What the hell just happened?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!	I can't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What just happened?	I don't know.  I lost him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They've burned through the outer shields.	Hurry, Neo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?	Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?	Follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.	Let go of her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	That means it's good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, all we got is $40.	You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.	Well the guy over there said...

<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Ok.  Wait here.

Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.	Uh...can we give you a check?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Anybody wanna have a game?
<EOC>	<EOC>
May God be with you.	'And with your spirit.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's the girl?	Jewish...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at her.	She don't look Jewish.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep your mouth shut.	You tell me that in front of these creeps?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Scumbag--	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?	Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.	This is some boat.  Your father's?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey... you got stereo.	Yeah, I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just keep him quiet.	Friends of yours Michael.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must have been all the liquor in him.	Quiet please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?	Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- But he does seem very nice.	You think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look who's talking.	Yeah, speak for yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dinner?  Again?	Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy!  Come on, a name.	Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just plain 'Joe'?	Love that name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was 'Joe'.	He's cute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?	A name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey, please.	Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the Mayor?	He said he would be there with bells on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, but --	But what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you do that for?	Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.	Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?	Both.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you eating.	You mean this, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Beautiful.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Did I hear 'business'?	What 'business'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... goodnight.	Yeah.  Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you for coming.	Hello, Quince.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?	Here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?	Why yes, thank you.
Hot or cold.	Cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	"""Death and Taxes""?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,	Of whom?
It doesn't matter.	Then why did you bring it up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I interrupting?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps you could remind me.	I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was saying to Quince we won't need --	Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --	No no, not you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Joe...'	Yes.
Is there any more to it?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have we met?	Uh -- he's from out of town --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No --	I get the feeling you've done some business before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we adjourn?	But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.	I thought this was practically a done deal --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I throw up?	Please, Drew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think it's time you went home, Drew.	Certainly.  Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In English, please.	Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're overthinking it --	I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I guess he's found one.	Joe, you do get around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.	Yeah.  Neat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not time yet.	Make it time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?	Yes.
My Doctor Lady?	Mine, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.	Hi, Jennifer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.	Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long you here, Joe?	As long as it takes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Black.	Hey, this is fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't bother asking, we already tried.	It's so very nice to see you again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think so?  How do you know?	Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	I'm lost.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Susan?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, Joe.	Goodnight to you, Susan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe --	How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's in a great deal of pain.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe, I'm with Drew.	Not now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --	Be sorry for nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you love peanut butter so much?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes...	It comforts you, doesn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I'm not.	Girlfriend?
No.	Gay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	To bed.
'To bed'?	Yes.  I'm tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You first.	Why don't you get off his case?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Almost.	I said get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry about --	Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love your smell.	-- I guess you haven't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	It was everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're here?	I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's taking a nap.	He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
<EOC>	<EOC>
...No.	Maybe it's the draft through the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you like making love to me?	I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Nowhere?  I'm...here.
For how long?	Oh, I hope a long, long time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like you in a black tie.	I love you in an evening gown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well -- I --	And you can't tell me who you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will we do?	'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?	It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?	Yes, that's why I said it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Susan --	-- Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No --	Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe, that's the kitchen.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a good idea.	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --	I won't.
How long have I got?	You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, thank you for letting me know.	Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.	Good night to you, Bill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill --	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe --?	Yes, Bill.
How about giving a guy a break?	Make an exception?
There's one to every rule.	Not this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to live.	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it like?	What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?	Can you keep a secret?
Yes.	So can I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to sit down, Joe?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I'd like to be alone.	Oh.  Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.	No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going to eat your lunch	It's all yours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And more.	Why didn't you stop me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --	This part I'm interested in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dinner?  Absolutely.	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  Goodnight.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Bill --	That's okay.
What's okay?	Just a manner of speaking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not hungry.	Then I can't help you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I couldn't sleep.	I'm sorry to hear that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	Not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell do you care?	I was just asking, Bill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.	Say again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're what?	I think you heard me, Bill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	Get him in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe, don't do this --	It's time to put this person where he belongs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy Birthday, Bill.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not exactly.	I guess you have your reasons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	That's life.  What can I tell you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?	I am not a dream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are --?	'...Yes --'
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to be your guide --?	You fill the bill, Bill.
I do?  How long will you be staying?	You should hope quite a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'...I know, it's none of my business.'	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Yes' what?	'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I didn't ask any question.	I believe you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you know --	I don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	What you were talking about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you giving me orders?	I'm sorry, I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you?  Are you there?	It's enough now.
Please.  Talk to me --	There's going to be plenty of time for that.
What do you mean?!	I think you know --
<EOC>	<EOC>

Good morning, Dad.	Hi, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like to interfere.	...Then don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not my birthday again?	You're only six-five once.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were in a meeting--?	I am.  With you.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you relieved?	Yes, but --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Daddy --	That's why it's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	The fireworks are about to start.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said you liked me.	No --
<EOC>	<EOC>
...We know so little about each other.	But we've got time.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, what the hell are you...?	Hurry, the woman needs help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The lights come up, you pull the switch.	I pull.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.	Nino, please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't do it!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way?	Across both tracks!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're no leaving you!	No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A shame.  You looked great tonight.	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think we did the right thing?	Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...	Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...	Maybe they lied to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Metaxonycha Godmani.	So?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey, just leave it.	No, there's...

Great crowd.	No such thing, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no, you were-	I was just late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's me. Can you hear me?	Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.	Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Jesus, no.	Toss the flare down!

C'mon...	Ah...
Talk to me.	Peter...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	You the bug lady, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It bit you.	No shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This wing configuration. I've never...	Fuck! It broke the skin...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's impossible.  Insects don't...	I know.  Help me get a sample.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here.	What are they...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.	It's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you so much.	My pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For a while I thought I might go crazy.	I know how that can be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then light the match, Paul.	No big deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, in case you think of any ideas.	Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about a bee...?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope you like it.	It looks wonderful. And so do you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Annie, I think we should have a toast.	A toast?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Annie, what is it?	The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.	Three more chapters to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.	Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop--stop right here.	What? What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.	G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were over it.	I am. Well, maybe not completely--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your room.	Mmmm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.	Oh, I am.  Later..
<EOC>	<EOC>
To win?	What else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You picked another winner!	Well, that's good, isn't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel like pleading for your life?	Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nyah!	Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
<EOC>	<EOC>

There she is.  I got visual.	We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.	He's heading down the stairs, now..
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.	How much longer before you can reach him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you mind if I'm on top?	Oh, either way works for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
- right..where is it?	Far right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wouldn't do that.	Do what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..	Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hola..	Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!	Oh Ethan!..
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Should I?	No.  You just looked as if you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.	Then you do think it was Ambrose.
<EOC>	<EOC>

You haven't once said you like my dress.	I like your dress.  It's very bright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why you looking around so much?	I don't know. I got a feeling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's wrong to just let them go.	Good morning, Lucy.

Loretta. What's that smell?	I'm making you a steak.
You don't have to help me.	I know that. I do what I want.
I like it well done.	You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.

How'd he die?	Bus hit him.
Fast.	Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?	Yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was right to leave me.	You think so?
Yes.	You really are stupid, you know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe what is happening.	Me neither.
I was dead.	I was dead, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>

It's so bright.	I've never seen a moon like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...	I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you!	For what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. Where are we sitting?	Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They get some turnout for this stuff.	It's the best thing there is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was just so... awful!	Awful?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No thanks.	I think that's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want to do now?	I wanna go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's really cold.	Yeah. It smells like snow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your place.	That's right.
This is where we're going!	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've gotta get outta here.	No. I'm gonna wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Loretta?	What!
<EOC>	<EOC>

Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?	You? No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Johnny Cammareri.	Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A man who can't control his woman is funny.	She was too young for him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never have dessert.	Never is a long time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have Something.	I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?	What?
Will you marry me?	Bobo, take the cart away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time is it?	Seven-thirty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.	You've made me very happy, Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Where's the ring?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you live here?	No.
Why not?	Pop don't like Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So we'll sell the house.	I got married before, you didn't sell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell happened to you?	Well. I don't really know where to start.
Your hair's different.	Everything's different.
Are you drunk?	No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.	Where's pop?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you love him, Loretta?	Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Loretta.	Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't make yourself sick.	Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Talk to him.	I will. But I must find the right moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moving in?	I came right from the airport.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it! That's the reason!	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Loretta...	Johnny...
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!	Good.
Have you come to make peace with me?	Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure she did.	It was a miracle!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I get another one of these?	Definitely!
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I presume to ask you a question?	Sure!
Do you have a girlfriend?	I am alone in the world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, comrade.	It's nothing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.	I'm not disturbed. By you.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry. That was rude.	Will you join me for dinner?
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I walk with you a ways?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You knew that man?	Yes.

<EOC>	<EOC>
The same!	Who are they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now stand aside worthy adversary.	'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.	No, it isn't.

I was told you were in a fight.	Yes, ma'am.
Has someone seen to those bruises?	Yes, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can we do?	Oh, several things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is my good John Brown.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see the Prince of Wales is here.	I hope he got his mother's permission.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he want?	To know when he'll be king.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A fine choice, sir.	Excellent!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Erysipelas.	Not too protracted, I hope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.	No, indeed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.	Whom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long has he been this sick?	A few days, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Read it.	Again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you play ARCADE with that?	"Well, technically ""yes"", but this is only the prototype."
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're having some problems with ARCADE...	Yeah, who isn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick, Alex, how are we today?	How'd you know it was us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what seems to be the problem?	It's the game, ARCADE.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Talk to me.	There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
<EOC>	<EOC>
"He thinks I'm ""sublimating""."	What the hell does that mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hey, kid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to talk to you.	We are talking...
No, in person.  Now.	It's twelve-thirty!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you turn off the game?	I'm in the middle of it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.	Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	She thought Benz was at school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where to now?	Laurie's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Change the channel!	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then leave her.	We can't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do we go?	My house.  I want to try something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SLIP-STREAM.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Virgin sacrifices?	Drives 'em crazy every time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ!	I can't believe you made it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got the schematics?	Everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex...	You didn't hear me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feel it?  It's different this time.	We're actually inside, aren't we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  Give us a kiss?	One.  In case...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.	Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way do you think Level Two is?	You've got the schematics, check.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The clock's already ticking.	Right, then...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.	There...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit...	Check your read-out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our time's up.	What?!  There's nothing here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck is that?!	Screamer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't reach that!	We don't have a choice!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ...no time...	There never is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go for it.	Hold my keys, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how did you do it, Alex?	Well, it's a long story...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then we'll go home?	Then we'll go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way?	That way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the wrong way!	In this world, wrong is right!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's here!!!	Oh God...oh god...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he do to you?	Is that your question?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?	Not yet, honey...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you think?	Sign me up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It means she's screwed up.	Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool.	"Can you say anything but ""cool""?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
So start at the beginning...	Give her a chance, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam, where are you?	What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.	What did you say?
They fired everyone.	Who fired everyone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's the problem?	There is no problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!	I'll speak to someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howdy!	Howdy to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess I've come to quite a place.	Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.	So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get going. You don't want to be late.	Right. See ya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is Rita.	Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're still here?	I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can call them... I can call my dad.	But you won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Diane?
Number 17.	But it said #12.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	You don't remember anything else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The money. You don't know where it came from?	Unh, unh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's nothing?	Not that I can see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. Just the coffee.	We'll take our check.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Strange to be calling yourself.	Maybe it's not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with that?	I'm not sure about this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""You're still here?"""	"""I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Before I kill you."""	"""Then they'd put you in jail."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't stop!	What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.	Do you know them?!
No... but...	Keep going. Go around to the back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think...	C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rita... I know what you're doing.	What ... I..HAVE... to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're so easy.	Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Yeah, what for?	Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, you came to see if he's out there?	To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feel it?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, they showed me	Could be unrelated.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?	No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that it ?	Yeah, I'd say that's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning. What do you have today ?	I have an embezzler and his accomplice.

I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.	Then go home, baby.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.	Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?	No, I'm hiding out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like this?	Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Close your eyes.	But then I won't be able to see anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just do it.	Okay, okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say something it's too quiet.	Umm, Ummmmm
<EOC>	<EOC>
You better not either.	Well, let's spit on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seeya tomorrow.	Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?	Would you think of me?
For what?	Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, it's in the contract.	Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay, huh?	I honestly wish I could...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't miss much.	Part of being a New Yorker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.	... weeks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think...	Desperate.  To talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He can't do that to me!	We're about to find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll never be the same.	I have a suggestion...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.	I can see why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was devastated.	Go figure you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...	You've been working on this, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zit cream?	I wish.
Neosporin?	Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.	That was Thursday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elmer's Glue?	DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I give.	I can't even say it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose it's too late to start over.	It's too late to start over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two words.	Major.  Dish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did what I came to do.	Good girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.	Oh, you're more than okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I can't be dry.	Can you watch the road?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...	... you want a menage on your wedding night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What else did he tell you...	... you hate weddings, you never go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He sucks soup through his front teeth.	A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.	It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, we're trapped!	Ju...
<EOC>	<EOC>
About Michael's job.	Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.	Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But he always says...	... whatever is manly and independent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For the twins? What in the world is th...	Gold nose hair clippers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll see right through it.	Only.  If he wants to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...	He won't get mad, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?	This must be... very, very, hard on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...	I love him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never want to go through this again.	That's entirely understandable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw the show.	... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think he's been fired.	It doesn't say th...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?	Nobody has.  So far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And she's all wrong for me!	Well, somet...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, sure.	But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, maybe we should talk ab...	I need you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please come, please.	W...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the sec...	Mirrors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every day.  She makes the bed.	Quite the little eccentric.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...	She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!	"She finds him ""personable."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where was that, Florence, huh?	Firenze.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I whistle down a cab?	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not eating.	I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.	I switched that around when you weren't looking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.	Like I said, dazzling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Big weddings are so strange.	You keep saying that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You miss her, huh?	No.  I've got you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you throw up on boat?	If you like.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can hardly wait for your wedding.	Me either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did we first hear th...	The night we met.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...	We danced to it.  Just like this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Takes me back.	Well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will she like it?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm up against a deadline.	Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This thing means that much to y...	It means a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	It's over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I asked you...	She admits it's her fault.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank God you were here.	Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.	Well, it happens.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... your one chance for true happiness?	... yeah, that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up?	Shhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh.  I saw that moving...	DON'T SPEAK!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...	... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would she come here...	This is where I proposed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never forgot that.	It's two weeks.
Almost three.	That is so romantic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not just a gag, huh?	No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And to m...	... and you knew about this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barnett?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.	Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry, I'll take care or it	You're so good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.	How did you come in here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.	I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.	Bye, Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>

She's fine.	Well, I just thought I'd call.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.	What did you say?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.	I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.	Maybe you can look after me a little.

More or less.	More or less...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...	What...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mickey!	Don't stop!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hasn't it?	We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.	Ain't love grand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Okay, Wayne, step forward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come you never talk?	She was born without a tongue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say something.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys stay on your bellies.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Sorry about that.	Don't worry about it.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?	Let's do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.	Aside from the obvious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could go for a Coke.	Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.	Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We ain't got all fuckin' day!	Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.	So, what now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's make a little music, Colorada.	NO!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah baby.	You made every day like kindergarten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I admire them.	I do, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hypnotizing.	Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.	That's the way of the world.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.	Survival of the fittest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's the layout of the laundry room.	Where do the air ducts lead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How immediate is immediately?	Next week's episode.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roger?	Rockin'!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.	Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?	Yeah, sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it working, Scotty?	Perfecto!

Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.	Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But how can you say that?	They're mesmerising.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give her a beer.	Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where' you goin'?	Out.
Want me to come?	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's going to buy me a beer?	What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.	Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?	See Duff. He's the money man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy - you hear me?!	That'll be thirty-eight cents.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That'll be thirty-eight cents.	You in a big hurry, boy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to keep your job, boy?	What d'you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said: Cut it out!	Don't start no trouble, boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?	I'll smile when it's funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Where was that?
Walker and Williams.	What did you say your name is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They say your dad's 'round town.	'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.	Where's he at?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.	Name's Duff.
How 'you doing?	Okay.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.	Thanks.
Don't say much, do you?	Guess I don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Guess so.	Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.	Where was your father born?
<EOC>	<EOC>
His profession?	Well, he worked around.
And his age?	I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?	No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.	Okay, thanks very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?	That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Well, they seem just like everyone else.	Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here!	Don't Duff--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go, Duff.	Take it easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surprised?	No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.	Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
That's right.	I'll see you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old is your boy?	Four.
What's he like?	I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	I thought you wasn't comin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What d'you mean?	Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about him?	He could live with us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that so?	Yeah, that's so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.	Come here, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know how to box?	Uh-huh. Why?
My kids want me to teach them.	Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!	I don't want to hurt you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?	Huh?
Don't look so scared.	You jivin' me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.	We'll be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.	What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?	I keep thinking about him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't, Duff.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No point fixin' it!	What're you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do that!	Watch out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Duff, I love you.	Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ain't you goin' to say something?	There's nothing to say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	Duff--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you gettin' all pretty for?	Why don't you relax, Frankie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where' you goin'?	'Round town.
What's so hot 'round town?	Take it easy, Frankie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just get her drunk.	How 'bout the key?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We was just leavin', fellows.	Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-bye, Frankie.	'Got a good thing, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you, Duff.	Yeah, see you in hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'See ya.	'Bye, Jocko.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'You Will Anderson?	Who're you?
I'm Duff.	Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.	What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.	Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a drink?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I asked you somethin', boy!	I heard you.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?	Great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Couldn't get the words out before.	Better get him to a hospital.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doin', boy?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want me to hold the light for you?	No, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seems a little loose!	She'll do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, I told you to watch it!	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come back some other time, will you?	Yeah, sure. Good luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Pop.	Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	How are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you guys buy your own?	'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, if it ain't Duff!	How you doin'?  Hi there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baby - want you to meet Duff.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's your son.	Okay, boy, beat it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now you stay put!	I ain't drunk, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got a thick feelin' here.	What's the matter now?
Better now.  Where 'you at?	Right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
We got any shots?	Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing in here?	The Elders, mon...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?	Straylight. Kitchen dock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that?	Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright. Let's talk business.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why'd you do it, Armitage?	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Did you trace it?	No, but it traced me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.	You see the couple up in the balcony?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got your orders.	This ain't Bangkok, chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?	Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw your girl yesterday.	I don't have a girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, bro.	It's Case. Remember me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...	Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.	Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What elders?	Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?	All things possible in Babylon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're doing fine. Take the next right.	This place empty as a tomb, mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four men. Babylon soldiers.	Can you walk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo.	How's the ice break?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...	Case.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait... You hear that?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to fucking answer them?	No!... No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Case.	I thought you already left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Case... are you okay?	I don't know. I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've been calling her name.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit...	Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have I been out?	Almost two days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How soon is soon enough?	Couple of days. They'll examine you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Feels like you.	Case...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Case... it's four a.m.	I don't sleep much. You packed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll get the car.	They'll cut you down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah... fine.	Give me five minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He projects with neural implants.	That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	What went down between you and Riviera?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he going to make it?	Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God... these people are insane.	Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm still going in.	Hold on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get up.	What?
How are you at riddles, Peter?	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck kind of questions are those?	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.	Yeah, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?	 uhh, must have forgotten-
<EOC>	<EOC>
YOU DID.	YOU KNIT?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well excuse me.	"What about the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""The 80's""?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
"My own undercover feature - ""Written by Josie Geller""."	Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
George! What are you doing here?	Just get in the van, Josie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?	Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.	Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Josie, you have totally transitioned.	Transitioned?
<EOC>	<EOC>
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He is totally crunching on you.	Do I want to be crunched?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?	Betty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, excuse me for caring about words.	So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many times have I fired her?	Five-- Six--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.	But I don't want it straightened out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you even know these kids?	They hid my car--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god.	Dude, you rock!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rob's?	Yeah, you gonna be there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey there.	Hey. There.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Rob, what's going on?	I'm Rob's prom date.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is so--weird that you name your car.	No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.	She just needs a new windshield wiper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?	Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -	Don't you remember what they called you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I mean, no big whoop.	I can't do this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.	And a gymnast!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow, Josie- you look really-	Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.	Thanks. And what are -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa. Deja Vu.	Sorry. Forgetful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This seat taken?	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yoooooow.	Don't look down!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to say that. You're my teacher.	I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.	When are you going to open your eyes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our penguin, right?	Do you think you'll find her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.	Thanks. So do you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?	Yeah, I have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please. Please don't walk away.	I just can't look at you the same way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.	I finally found my story.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.	Nah uh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Josie, you look Rufus.	Who are you guys?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ruined the whole thing!	You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aloha! Welcome!	Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you having fun?	Yeah. Definitely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.	Maybe we should sit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By name.	Lock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We followed your instructions.	We went through the door...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He <u>has</u> to know...	Everybody knows about--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shock.	Barrel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not at all!	We can handle it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He sure is big, Jack...	And heavy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where're we taking him?	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	For this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coming...	Good.  I'm hungry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-huh.	He stayed a long time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're here!  You sent for us!	Specifically.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.	Maybe he doesn't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got your room straightened out yet?	It's getting there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.	Who's Lisa?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.	Oh, come on Dad...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me with this thing!	It's not the gas, Dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come back here!	Ken!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesse, help!	I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.	He's dead, you bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?	What about it?
You two got a thing going, or what?	She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?	You got a problem with me, Grady?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You remember your dreams, Grady?	Only the wet ones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.	Shut up, Grady.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	It's happening again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.	That's okay, I wanted to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah, yeah, sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.	Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I figured you might like some help.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know her?	Uh-uh.  Before my time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think it's sad...	Traumas of a ten-year old.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here.	What's this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, you feeling anything?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any ghosts in here?	C'mon, cut it out.
Well, what am I supposed to do?	I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel like a jerk.	Shhh.  Just concentrate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything?	Uh-uh.  Wait...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Disappointed?	About what?
About not finding any bogey men?	I'll get over it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it - What's wrong?	Whoa!
What is it?	I don't know - a sharp pain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gone now.	Oh, Jesse...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesse, God - what happened?	I killed him!  I killed him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Morning.	'Morning, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jess?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.	You okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, school going alright?	Okay, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we should call a doctor.	No.  I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!	I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning.	How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a Jesse on the phone.	Okay...thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
You're going out?	We're going to bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going up to bed now.	Thanks, Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you don't want to keep him waiting.	That's right.  I don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I had such an awful dream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?	Can't it wait till morning?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Jennifer.	Morning, Doctor Goldman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?	Deal.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Horseshit.	No, she's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?	No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	He's close...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?	I -- I think so!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Freddy?	He's heavy in the halls...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.	How do we find him, Kristen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nancy!	He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.	Why is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max, where's Kristen?	She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You need me, I'll be here all night.	Thanks, Max.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know...	It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got five minutes.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's over.  It's over.	Nancy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late.	Didn't get much sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To who?	Doesn't matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sound like Peter Pan.	Remember -- open mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can try again.	Everybody take five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nancy...	I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you do, take the scenic route?	Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, straight talk only in here.	What about Kristen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got work to do.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody else is out here.	No.  We're alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is he after us?	Yeah?  What did we ever do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're here.	Where...here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm in.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?	Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think of the guinea fowl?	I'm a vegetarian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute.  What about me?	I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was such a great evening.	I'm delighted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.	Now you're lying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	Night, night, Honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Jesus.	Here, let me help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh hi.  Forget something?	I forgot my bag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here we go.	Thanks.  Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you busy tonight?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Too complicated.	That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?	I thought you were leaving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoopsidaisies.	What did you say?
Nothing.	Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.	You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
So who left who?	She left me.
Why?	She saw through me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Can I come in?	Come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh please sod off.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I stay a bit longer?	Stay forever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Don't ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is certainly... ah...	I only found out you were here yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes...	Who is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me.	Yes.
Can I have your autograph?	What's your name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's bringing a girl?	Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?	He wouldn't say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right.	And this is William.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bella -- this is Anna.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still loves you though.	In a depressingly asexual way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.	Tony -- what do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This painting isn't the original, is it?	Yes, I think that one may be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bloody hell, this is fun.	Is Miss Scott staying here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bernie -- this is Anna.	Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By the way -- it's you.	Me?
Yes.  What do you think?	Well, yes.  Groovy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was called and I came.  What's up?	William has just turned down Anna Scott.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	It was good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah -- no.  It's fine.	What's your name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Thacker?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you a fan of Henry James?	This is Henry James film?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Martin -- your customer.	Can I help you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max.  This is Anna.	Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So I get the brownie?	I think you do, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?	No -- did you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	She's perfect, perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So -- you've laid the ghost.	I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.	No, don't think I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God no.	So not over her, in fact.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.	Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, sir.	How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.	Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, sir.	Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something wrong with this yogurt.	It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hi...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Try 'Flintstone.'	What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'	Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.	You're welcome.  Did you find them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wouldn't go outside.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.	Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which floor?	Three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure you...?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was she?	Fabulous.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Whew! Hiya, boys!	Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He is your husband, no?	Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I see your boarding pass, please?	I-- I must've misplaced it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ask what room he's in, okay?	Buona notte.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what's the story with your friend?	My friend has lost her fucking mind...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were they pen pals?	No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?	Your hair... is perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.	Let's find a telephone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.	You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?	Yes.  We did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's dying?	Your great aunt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?	Oh no.  Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a liberal!	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.	Dwayne?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A very large pig.	Ask her if she knows where he is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.	Wait.  I have to write this down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll KNOW.	Okaaaaayyyy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.	But Faith--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You...	Hi there...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's an amazing place, don't you think?	Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?	Non.  Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not the point.	You said whatever it was you would understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How could you do this to me?	I'm in love with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're limping.	I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay?  You want some help?	NO.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why can't you just tell me?	If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.	Yes.
To the foot doctor.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	Because.  I know where he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Because-- I want you to be happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, I'd rather not say.	Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.	Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.	Mickey Spillane?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's out by the pool right now.	Right now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want me to do it?	NO.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Peter.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And she's a knock-out, too.	Well, good.  Good for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.	You too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey--	What?
Nice dress.	Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?...	What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were saying...	Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about music?  You like classical?	The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.	No.  Course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?	No.  I just came by to apologize.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.  I am.	In that case... no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is something the matter?	GET OUT!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?...	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was hoping for the real thing.	I brought you that, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're Damon Bradley?	Uh huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Beautiful place...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Been here long?	Just since yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?	Tonight?
Any night.	Well, not exactly...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.	You would?  Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll look forward to it.	Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?	Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.	Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, to-- new friends.	And more...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What looks good?	Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you think?	Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faith, this is my mother.	Oh, hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what are we waiting for?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe in statistics.	You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?	No.  He smokes.
How about the other one?  His friend.	Just moved in with his girlfriend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scientologist.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Is he married?
No.	Is he gay?
I don't know.  I don't think so.	So?...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he do?	I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?	He's a podiatrist or something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kate, is something the matter?	Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...	I think he's having an affair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen him with someone?	No...  I can just tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a miracle.	It's a coincidence.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	He fell out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're saved!	What is it?
A phone message.  Only--	Only what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You expecting somebody you know?	Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faith--	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter found him?	Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joan Collins stayed here.	Is Damon Bradley here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.	Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kate is that you?	Uh huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's siesta.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Giovanni, I want to thank you.	I thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is the last one before the wedding, right?	Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I came after the woman I love.	He missed me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.	Gimme.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.	In a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Working hard?	It's a living.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.	Nolan? I knew he had guts but
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?  What happened?	Tommy, what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terry...?	Terry... Terry... .
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we're O.K.	Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.	Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.	I'll get home all right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?	Do you like pigeons?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd better go in.	I only live up there and across the roof.
Thanks anyway.	Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.	Good. So do I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen, you like beer?	I don't know.
Want to go out and have one with me?	In a saloon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wham... .	How do you like it?
It's quite  nice.	How about another one?
No thanks... .	Hit me again, Mac.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not sore at me?	What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pigeons... .	There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terry what's happening to you?	I just told the Father.
Told him what?	What I did to Joey.
You... .	What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!	Edie it's
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terry, you're bleeding.	Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Terry, for God's sake.	Get out of my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I on my feet...?	Terry...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you goin'?	Let me by.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to see you, Terry.	You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.	What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.	Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.	Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.	You go to hell.
What did you say?	You go to
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can!	I can? Okay.  Okay...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never will be much too soon.	Take it easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.	Sure... .
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.	O.K., O.K., That's enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's a he. His name is Swifty.	My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Johnny in?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me a double.	Take it easy now, Terry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with your shoulder?	Hit me again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No advice. Just whiskey.	Easy. Easy, boy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terry?  What do you want?	Hey look-
<EOC>	<EOC>
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I	Gimme.
<EOC>	<EOC>
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?	So-so, Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Count this.	Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.	By way of Chicago?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got some nerve.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?	Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look!	Be careful!--They'll see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
You love me then?	Of course I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But they are not yet one of us.	A situation easily remedied.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The time...is short.	For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!	You mean...!
You may take her now.	Is there time?
You better hope there is.	Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They are live ones?	Yes, Master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?	Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could make her another Cleopatra...	Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, is this Adele?	Yes, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to speak with you, please.	Who is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lie face down on the floor.	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ask him his name.	Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're good.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adele?  You in there?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	You better come see this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess Adele's in good hands.	Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.	Now you're talkin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?	What's he do now, tell fortunes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know they gonna set us up.	I get that feeling, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's still time, take me up on my offer.	I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever wear one of these?	I don't ski.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They found the safe.	You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They look like plain old rocks.	They sure do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come <i>on</i>.	Shit.
What?	They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.	And then they'll kill 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We made it, didn't we?	All you gotta do is get in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going back inside.	I'll go with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Daniel.	Daniel Burdon, FBI.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get the key?	They're in 7D.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.	You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?	The manager's door is metal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put it down or I'll shoot.	You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?	I could walk out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.	Excuse me, Adele?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You excited?	I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.	Why you think is today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ironic, isn't it?	How are you, Raymond?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karen, I told you not to--	Wait, I know him --okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much for your company at chow?	Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.

Good luck, Richard.	Someone down here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your gun, your pistol?	In my bag, in the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.	Shit...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know who this is?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like taking risks.	So do you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really wear that suit.	That's not what you were about to say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I saw you on the street.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You coming back?	I'm just going to the bathroom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Jack -- don't.	Pretend I'm somebody else.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.	You just did, for Christ sake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take your sunglasses off.	I see better with them on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whose blood you got all over you?	These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds high, doesn't it?	Must be a real soft pillow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for your help.	Any time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll send it to you at Glades.	Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do we have a gun in the car?	I remember you now.  Shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?	Jesus, I don't believe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was some shit, huh?	Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going?	Great.  We got one of 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a fighter?	How you know that?

<EOC>	<EOC>
You were talking in your sleep.	What'd I say?
"""Hey, yourself."""	Huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you thinking about?	The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He doesn't even look like that.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was it Foley?	Off a tip?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?	I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?	He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You here all by yourself?	That's right, just me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.	I don't have any idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do I look, mama?	Like a fag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.	Likewise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you pay the guy the reward?	Yeah, as soon as we got back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faux goose down.	Still...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.	Are those <i>my</i> suits?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have a problem here?	Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...the fuck is this...	Are they dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure they're here?	If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish she could forget him.	You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.	Where's that lizard?
What lizard?	The one that slept in my mouth last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.	You guys are new?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, he's puking on my feet!	Well, you p-puked on his feet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They ready, Earl?	They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the fuck taught you to fly?	He did.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Land of the free.	Home of the brave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm out of ammo!	I'm out of fuel!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not getting any longer.	Longer?  It's getting shorter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Danny...	I can't make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So beautiful!	Hang on.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
All right. What's the scoop?	On what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I bet Dolores told Charlie.	That loudmouthed little bitch~
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lucky lady. Hi.	Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.	Why do guys do such stupid things?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie really has a great voice.	Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peggy Sue!	You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!	Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.

But you love me don't you?	Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?	I'm not going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel?	Pretty strange.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want me to drive you home later?	Would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?	Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
He's trying.	Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry Charlie.	Save it.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Charlie.	Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you study for the test?	Test?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terry, slow down.	Okay.
Terry! Slow down.	What, why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was Beth's idea.	I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.	It must run in the family.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't get your hopes up.	Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Charlie!	What a treat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ssh. He's great.	Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought I knew everything about him.	Can we split now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Dad.	Doing some shopping?
<EOC>	<EOC>
For me?	Open it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A new car. We can't afford a new car.	Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack, I was just trying to help.	We'll make it, we'll be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.	Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom!	The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have a note.	How do you feel?
I'm excused.	Why don't you go lie down for a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.	Of course, dear. You're home now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did you start drinking coffee?	"Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you get that, dear?	Sure, Mom.  Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?	For what?
Maddy's party.	I don't feel very festive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where have you been?	I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not the maid!	Way to go, Mom!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would they go over my girdle or under?	Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think this'll cheer Dad up?	Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I remember that dress.	Rosalie Testa!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.	It really wasn't that difficult.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're taking advantage of a minor.	When do we start?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Renee alright.	I suppose so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You took over for Doctor Yolander?	Yes... why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to you?	I had a little run-in with Zowie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long ago did this guy retire?	It's been a few years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! How was your first day at school?	It sucked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! Where're you off to?	I'm going out, Dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!	I'm not hungry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All set?	All set.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So where're we going?	Anywhere but here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.	Just until he heals up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's his name?	Zowie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.	He pissed me off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this a good spot?	I'm not burying him here...
Why not?	There's a better place...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's getting pretty late. We better go.	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.	He was dead. You know he was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can he not have a heartbeat?	Maybe it takes a while...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's weird...	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta go back and do my chores...	Go later...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever think about running away?	All the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?	Right here, Mom...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know, Mom.	You know everything, don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we interrupting, Andy?	In a word, Bob...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	I don't know what to do, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was the file name?	K-R-O-one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, Beckett?	Because they deserve to, Walter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, Walter.	What's that on your forehead, pal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're right, I probably just misfiled...	Andy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This time. What about next time?	There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, you guys.	Yeah. Thanks, guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you giving an exam?	I said, don't worry about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It could be parasites, an infection...	A reaction to AZT...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with you?	Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--	CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, Charles.	No sweat, buddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for coming in.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know that, Charles.	More than your friend. Family.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.	I'm seeing him this afternoon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...	About my blood work?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Innocuous?	Defined by Webster's as harmless.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Client of yours?	Funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?	I have AIDS.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...	It's okay. Can I sit down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I buy that.	As in, the vegetable?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who'd you get?	What?
Find a lawyer?	I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.	What's her name?
Rayisha.	Rayisha. Very nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is no relevant precedent.	Arline decision. Supreme Court.
<EOC>	<EOC>
PARRTYY!	We're friends of Beckett's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...	I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a law suit.	Not bad.
Get it?	Let's find you a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think I'm uncomfortable...	Correct.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Opera?	Want to hear my favorite aria?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll look over the Q and A.	You're ready, don't worry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for coming by.	You bet. We'll see you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hi, Mom. It's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?	Yes.
Were you recently promoted?	Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A homosexual encounter.	Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.	Uh.... No. Not really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have a problem with gays, Joe.	Not especially.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many gays do you know?	How many do you know?
Lots.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?	My lettuce is wilting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll see you in an hour, max.	Night, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.	Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.	Any women on board?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. But we took care of him.	How did you do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You taught him a lesson.	Yes, we did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's continue.	"You had one guy ""like that?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julius!	Dr. J.!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be sorry, Beckett.	Andy, you don't want this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't wanna miss this.	Lookit. Lookit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....	<u>What</u>?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me that was you.	Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?	Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bring the light!	What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see? Riddick?	Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Riddick? What the hell are you --	<u>Listen</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back to the ship, huh?	Get out of our way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many you see?	One or two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
As fast as you can.	You sure you can keep --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!	We can't make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just come with me!	Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Step aboard, Carolyn.	I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.	Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.	But they...they could still be....
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do my eyes see?	It's starting....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ, you don't know what's out there!	I know what's in here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There....	Like the light is scalding it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey, who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Amazing. I'm Johns.	Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Tell me it's not a mirage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.	Probably right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better keep moving....	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't bite.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry. Thought I heard something.	Like what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He used that?	Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?	I assume he licked it clean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --	So what happened? Where are they, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!	'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much you weigh, Johns?	What the hell's it matter?
How much?	79 kilos.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you noticed too?	Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We cannot go through there....	How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One is all?	For now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hasan?	Riddick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The sled as a shield....	And what about the cells?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no. No, no, no....	Rain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?	Has anyone checked the coring room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Mr. Johns?	Which half?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suleiman!	Get the girl back under. Keep going.
SULEIMAN!	KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""God is Great,"" yes?"	I'm born-again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.	Please...this solves nothing...please....
<EOC>	<EOC>
...then we saw this.	Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are these?	Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.	Like an emergency life-raft, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very big beads.	Not staying in here another....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you fuckin' kidding me?	Not afraid of the dark, are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd rather piss glass.	Well, you got the big gauge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think about that reward, Johns.	I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"<u>Fuck me</u>. You said ""clear."""	"Said ""looks clear."""
Well, what's it look like now?	Looks clear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.	No. She's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ain't all of us gonna make it.	Just realized that, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's her name, anyway?	What do you care?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So much for your nightfall.	So much for my cocktail hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it.	What, it's broken?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Zaius --	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.	Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.	Just the same, I want one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have to work tonight?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, just a minute --	Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which direction?	That way.
Any particular reason?	None at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.	Let's find them all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.	Blessed are the vegetarians.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?	Him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Objection!	Sustained.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Dr. Zira.	Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.	Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Landon! Send a last signal.	What signal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's no use ... there she goes.	Forget it. Abandon ship.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gone.	We're here to stay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scarecrows?	Let's take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we take a dip?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No cigar.	Try telling them our names.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't we be moving on?	I'm for that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lucius.	I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you not to bring the other one.	He wouldn't leave her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gorilla hunters ...	Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who put them up?	The Hunt Club.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	A man, Dr. Maximus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.	My name is Taylor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One is in a museum!	Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
ThatÕs a lie!	Mind your tongue, madame.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sustained.	Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?	With one of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop right there.	Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell him to pull back!	Cease fire! Withdraw!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?	Listen, listen -- I can speak --
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's him...Landon.	Which one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?	She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.	Taylor, you can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to come along?	We can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.	All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's moving his fingers!	Of course. He saw you moving yours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?	Yes, Sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.	Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bunker...	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I SHIT on all o' you.	KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!	Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's the problem?	Says he can't walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lame Taylor?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's he from?	Barnes comes from Hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...	I got one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Taylor! Francis!	Over here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!	Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Lerner?	Out there man - behind the log.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on man!	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Taylor, you okay man?	Yeah. How 'bout you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
First time?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel good?	Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But what'd she actually do?	She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dawn! That was it!	Dawn...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go with you.	No... I move faster alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?	Nah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thanks...	Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You volunteered for this shit man?	You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What we got here a crusader?	Sounds like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merle?	Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whew! - where that come from?	Found it. Growing in a garden.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.	Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.	That's what he is... Baaaa!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.	My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The brush-off, huh?	I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I'd like to dance.	Why certainly, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you're drunk.	Just drunk enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They might think I was running away from something.	Possibly, Miss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dance?	No thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know it's a littler late for an apology.	Much too late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.	I'd rather wait until it does matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You tried to run away.	There wasn't any plane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a spike in it?	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bad?	Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.	That's putting it mildly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cold?	Is this the best you can do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to dance?	Dance? Here?
Why not?	They know you here--know your name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?	Absolutely sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?	Nothing matters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	You leave it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cold?	Frozen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you mean that.	Do you think I was faking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Miss.	I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.	Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?	Ale. I don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please answer my question.	You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.	It is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?	Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I'm sorry.	Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What this?	Yes.
Where's you get it?	A graduation present.
<EOC>	<EOC>
FLorida?	I've never been to Florida.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't a very good place to talk.	I don't want to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.	I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like a few words with you, in private.	I'm not interested in blind dates.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?	In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.	Fascinated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'll you have, Margo?	Martini.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?	Sometimes.
And without much discrimination.	Leave that one lay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	A private joke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Yes, I've seen it before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In case you want to have us followed.	I don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time for a little chat?	If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?	Lay off, can't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.	Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?	Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?	I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Recently, then.	No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.	The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.	I've met her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.	Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not too hard, is it?	Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was that about the right angle?	I think so.
Where's the shell?	Should be over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May you what?	Oh nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scotch and plain water, I think.	Warm water, no doubt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never saw it before.	Positive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about me?	Not quiet yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No doubt about that one.	How about Magruder?
He checks too.	That leaves two strangers.
So far.	Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?	She might.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?	The card says so, doesn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I believe you won decorations during the war.	Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here!	What are my orders, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.	I say YES!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	We'll see you next week, and if--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we go?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Sit on that log, dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now first of all, tell us your name.	Penfield.  James Penfield.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.	Exactly that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's terribly good.	Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Committed to memory.  Forever.	I see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations.  Who with?	A glamorous young lady way above his station...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So it's all worked out perfectly...	That's her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn.  They're early.	Who?
I called you a taxi.	Very thoughtful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Again?	Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.	You just might.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we have a drink or something?	Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't seem to get much time to talk.	I know.  I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.	No jokes.  James is in love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To the Fleet.	To the Fleet.
And the Argies.	The Argies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, top secret file.	Come on.  Hand over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's enough of that.	We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still in love?	I'm not sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Jimmy.	Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't point it at James!	Voila!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you got there?	You'd look naked without one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll see what we can do.	Promise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Susy, it...	Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you want to walk, Tom?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?	No, Bells Beach, Australia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta be fucking crazy.	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gonna jump or jerk off?	My man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Utah, you copy bruddah?	Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gonna pull?	After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't screw around man, pull it!	You do it... you first!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!	You first!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not armed.	But you're not alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three seconds... two... one...	SHIT!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wild ride, huh?	Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.	Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you gotta hit them straight on!	Got it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aw shit.	Nice tattoo, Dietz.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're on their way to Maui.	No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time for lunch.	Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The hell are they?!	They took a left at the next light!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know where they're going.	Figured you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Angelo!  Don't fire!	Kid, get outta the way!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's goin' on?	Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those are cold.	Warm them up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch.	Betadyne doesn't hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what'd the other guy look like?	Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?	Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!	Who cares!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?	Something... in the trees...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?	No way, old buddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're wastin' your time.	No more games.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll see you there.	Right behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	Anytime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You saw what?	I saw it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're looking well, Dutch.	It's been a long time, General.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.	There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?	I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Major, you'd better take a look at this.	Hawkins?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What in God's name...?	I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?	There's no sign of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your uncle will like this.	He's not really my uncle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that long building over there?	Storage, I think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, sir.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you going after next, sir?	Who indeed...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Harris.	How are you, Mr. Kross.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... I would take advantage of it.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice car.  Yours?	No.
Stolen?	Not exactly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I turn on some heat?	If you can figure it out, be my guest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ugly habit, biting your nails.	You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you charge for company, Vivian?	Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?	For an hour.
You're joking.	I never joke about money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three hundred.	Fine.
What's your name, lover.	Edward.  My name is Edward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get in.  This side.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Room service.  What do you drink?	Diet coke.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.	Can I have some chips?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's talk some more first.	Right.  So!  In town on business?
Uh-huh.	Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?	I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.	I've known a lot of everybody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they?  Shopping together?	They should be.  They're both good at it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a very good year.	Oooh, thank god.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are a very beautiful girl.	Just a romantic, that's you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I buy companies.	No shit.  They expensive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.  How much for the week?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'd cost you.	Of course.  How much?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	You're forgiven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.	Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about dinner?	Dinner can wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You still mad at'm?	He died a long time ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.	I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?	I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!	Vivian, what the --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I look okay?	Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Edward, I can't.	Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?	You won't.
What if someone tries to steal it?	I'll guard them and you with my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One more night and you're finally rid of me.	Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got tired of hating my father.	It was good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't think so.	Vivian...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.	Afternoon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Edward, did you hear me?	I'm here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.	Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think there's any sense in --	Let him answer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?	Have a good day, gentlemen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?	Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carlos had some great rock.	I bet.  That was our rent!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a pair of boots?	Do I!?  Momma!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you won't come with me?	And leave all this?  Not in a million.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm just going to my room.	You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.	And who is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Vivian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I help you?	I'm just looking, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you looking for something in particular?	Yes.  Something... conservative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to try it on?	'Scume me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.	I was in here yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Having a good time, Vivian?	Yeah.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He will come for me.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every ship but the four you sent.	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.	Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.	I do not marry tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I killed him myself.	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it bother you to hear?	Nothing you can say will upset me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... as ... you ... wish...	Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.	As you wish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're quick.	And a good thing too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No more rhymes now, I mean it.	Anybody want a peanut?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I only dog paddle.	Veer left. Left. Left!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably he means no harm.	He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.	Yes, some of the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?	If there are, we'll all be dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	It's you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Fezzik, please --	Everybody ... MOVE!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?	Over the Albino, I think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will this do?	Where did you get that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.	Right, right, sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Inigo.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!	I'll be right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I brought you a special present.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --	I don't be-leeve this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For the last time -- SURRENDER!	DEATH FIRST!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And it is guarded by sixty men.	And our assets?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now?	Light him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Fezzik?	I thought he was with you.
No.	In that case --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No --	-- offer me money --
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- yes --	-- power too -- promise me that --
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- all that I have and more please --	-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --	I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know any way you'll trust me?	Nothing comes to mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll wait until you're ready.	Again. Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are wonderful!	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because I know something you don't know.	And what is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're amazing!	I ought to be after twenty years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something I ought to tell you.	Tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?!	No one of consequence.
I must know.	Get used to disappointment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Making sure nobody's following us.	That would be inconceivable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.	Inconceivable!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I accept.	Good. Then pour the wine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye-bye, boys.	Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?	It would take a miracle. Bye!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feeling any better?	A little bit.
Guess what.	What?
Your grandfather's here.	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.	What are you saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""By the light, by the light,"	"""Of the silvery moon,"
"""Of the silvery mooooon,"	"""I want to croon,"
"""He wants to croon, he wants to croon,"	"""To my honey I'll croon,"
"""He's gonna croon love's tune,"	"""Honeymoon,"
"""Honeymoon, honeymoon,"	"""Keep a shining in..."
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?  A handkerchief?	It's nothing ... nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So much for Nutsy Fagin.	Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To failure!	To failure!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never should have listened to you.	Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max, I...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.	With whom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...	Come on.  Let's get going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Min Bialystock.	Nice girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.	Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.	No.  We go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finder's keepers.	Here I come, ready or not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like clockwork.	I shall count the minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I solemnly swear...	By the sacred memory...
By the sacred memory...	Of Siegfried...
Of Siegfried...	Wagner...
Wagner...	Nietzche...
Nietzche...	Bismark...

Hindenburg...	Hindenburg...

Heil you know who!	Heil you know who!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?	Send for Goebbels.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's all talk about Mary.	Who are you, friend?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your interest?	Money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Must've needed it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She stole some money.	A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.	And the police haven't been able to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did he say anything about my sister?	Just what he told your detective.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	May I talk to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Mary's sister.	Lila.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What thing?	Huh?
What thing could we be in together?	I hate tears.
Is Mary... in trouble?	Yes.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?	Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably on his way back right now.	Sam, I'm going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go see Al Chambers.	Who's he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.	You're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.	Of course we will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't go up there.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's regular. Okay?	I could stand something regular.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.	Los Angeles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You eat like a bird.	You'd know, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute!	Now what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I see your license?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh?	Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Went out before service.	Have you two had breakfast?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just coming up to ring for you.	I suppose you want a cabin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take you to...	Better sign in first, hasn't we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll get your bags.	Haven't any.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My mother is not dead!	I didn't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They thought she'd be coming to me.	Left Phoenix under her own steam?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	From what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't find anything.	Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No-	Who are you? What is your name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.	Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh	Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?	Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Meirschultz, please.	He isn't here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	I'm going to call the police.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	The wound is bleeding!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it now?	I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What were you dreaming about?	A voice ...
That spoke to you?	That called ... commanded ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your father?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear?	Yes, the child ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The child!	Yes.
There's no child here.	But ... the dogs...
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no child here, and no dogs either.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But what about lunch?	I'll have it for supper.  So long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think so.	Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll be coming to the opening.	At any time. You will always be welcome.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one is me? The horse?	Get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He might get some publicity out of it.	No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	You go in for dangerous things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it? What happened?	Don't ask any questions. Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we unpack it?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you laughing at?	He can't hear you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was her name?	Excuse me???
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mia...?	Yes....
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been dreaming about you.	Day or night?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could we go somewhere?	I'm heading out of town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I could go out of town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you?	Where to?
A place you've never been.	That's the physicist's playground.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why am I doing this?	It's an experiment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could be.	What universe are you in, Paul?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing is real until it's perceived.	The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of what?	God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been dreaming about this.	Then you get it.  You'll understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	So I can move on.  You too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I know.	Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!	All right, what do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were up late last night, Brother.	Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?	Well, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son, was Rose in your room last night?	No. Why should Rose be in my room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.	Yeah, he's still up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Open that door, damn you!	Daddy, what's the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.	I think Daddy suspects.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There goes Mother.	Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think she's gonna kiss him.	At least.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?	They're discussing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I can't see. What are they doing?	Boy! Wow!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow! Brrrother!	What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.	What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.	Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.	Let me look.  Aww-rr...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's putting the titty back.	Buddy, that was my place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Mother, he's lying...	Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is it taking so long?	Here comes Daddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, she's back.	What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.	Is she all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is she?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rose, what are you doing up?	Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?	No, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.	Got yourself up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can the buttons stand the pressure?	There are more on the other side.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were up late last night, too, Rose.	Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this ill right?	It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...	Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Took your time gettin' here.	She has other things to do, Dave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter with him?	I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Ma'am.	Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to go to the dentist.	Be quiet, Rose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never again, never again...	I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...	It'll get better now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?	Yes, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rose, you don't have to.	I don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.	I was offered that job as a waitress.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indivisible and inseparable.	Incestuous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey now... what the fuck... ?	Again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... I can't find my seatbelt.	What do you want me to do about it?

You could start over again with cash like that.	Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.	There probably is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He tried to kill us.	We've got the tape to prove it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pure horse.	You are such a disappointment, Benny.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.	I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.	Where am I?
Jabba's palace.	Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>

You got her warmed?	Yeah, she's comin' up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.  Fly casual.	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought she was with you.	We got separated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	Han, don't. It'll be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone who loves you.	Leia!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	I don't know.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Lando, grab it!	Lower it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck.	You, too.

<EOC>	<EOC>
We're coming!	Come on! Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?	Let's see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All wings report in.	Red Leader standing by.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good shot, Red Two.	Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going in.	Here goes nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ugh!	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!	Your Royal Highness.

<EOC>	<EOC>
He's my father.	Your father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Emperor has been expecting you.	I know, father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come with me.	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Obi-Wan has taught you well.	I will not fight you, father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cannot hide forever, Luke.	I will not fight you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yoda, I must know.	Your father he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Told you, did he?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...	Unfortunate that I know the truth?

Do you have any tattoos Brad.	Certainly not!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You!	I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why you - what have you done with Janet?	Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promise you won't tell?	On my mother's grave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Janet!	Rocky!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The future is ours so let's plan it.	Janet.
So please don't tell me to can it.	Janet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Janet.	Made me give you the eye And then panic,
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Janet	For you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Brad, I'm mad.	Dammit, Janet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that bang?	We must have a blow-out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm coming with you.	There's no point both of us getting wet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brad...	It's alright Janet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.	You know this earth - this person.
<EOC>	<EOC>

You?	That's right, me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.	No...

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold on a second.	Eddie, come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!	Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I will follow you.	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nurse.	Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's under your seat.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We kept it...	Is that right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never did trust that blonde fuck...	That's why you were riding with him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lose them!	You lose them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
About time!	Not yet...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?	They're good!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I need to repeat myself?	No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.	You were a soldier, were you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I better be getting that.	Duty calls?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, Gregor, I'm...	Ready when you are...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the case?	There's a problem...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's yours.	There's been a slight problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's my information?	In here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And more importantly --	I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll die if we stay here!	You'll die if you leave here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it done?	It's done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So this is what, a test?	Call it a reckoning of character.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, well...  My way works too.	My way is better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.	What a surprise...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They call me Swede.	Who's they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry I'm late...	What makes you think we're here to meet you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps the police?	I know cops -- and you're no cop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cigarette?	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He trusts you to lock up?	Let's just say he knows who I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.	Coordinate what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where to?	To see a man about a thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty much what you'd expect.	That's what I thought.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you say to him?	I asked if we could give him anything else.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I needed to know.	You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The question still remains: what do we do now?	Gregor's cell phone...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I borrowed that, too...	Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.	But you can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know him?	I know of him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Irish representative?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure your friend got the right place?	If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They don't have the package.	You think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck happened?	I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not here very much.	Business keeps you on the road?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do we need anything else?	Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to stop doing that!	I'll work on it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get him out of here...	Finish the job...
And now...	Finish it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You son-of-a-bitch...	What?
You speak French.	What of it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gaelic.	You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you kill her?	Why didn't you kill him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have the tape?	I might know where you could get a copy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you get it?	The Russian would be easier.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn.	I want to get some hounds down here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready to roll, partner?	Sure thing, and --
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?	The horniest dog in Nevada.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell...	They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten thousand right here.	There must be over a million dollars in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call it in I guess.  Why?	Why?  Are you kidding me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll torch the bases, how's that?	Torch it?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got one condition.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shhh!	What are you gonna do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's going to be trouble.	He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're out of your mind.	Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think he's bluffing?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long is it going to take?!	I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here it is.	There it is...now what about the others?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we should say somethin'.	Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?	I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Jesus...	He killed her...he killed her...
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?	He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!	He killed her...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too late...	It's NOT too late!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are ya?	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.	Has he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got me something?  What's the occasion?	You deserve it is the occasion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...	Nothing happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're worth every last penny.	Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So do I.	I love you Sally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A satellite dish?	Well I was just throwing out ideas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.	I don't believe it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sally, do you love me?	You know I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be more specific.  A month, a week...	A week ago, at most.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Test the product?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	This just might be our ticket!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, no...	Don't you think I would have told you that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.	Did you say After Midnight?

And you are?	Looking for Maggie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you'd look good in red.	No, she's talking about your hair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your two cinnamon rolls.	Bye, Betty.  Thanks.

Where did you disappear to?	Missed me bad, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.	I kissed him back.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy New Year, darling.	Happy New Year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.	You couldn't.
I do.	It's just like my grandmother's china.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walter.	It was my mother's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beautiful view, isn't it?	Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.	I think that's what I'm saying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should write something about this.	About what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that about up there?	What was what?
What's with you?	Nothing's with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you Annie?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --	Walter and I are engaged!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's probably just the flowers --	We'll move them --
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you'll get married in a new dress.	It's a sign.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure you do.	Sure you do --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's you.	It's me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which means --	The cabinets have to be redone --
<EOC>	<EOC>
All righ...	Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.	Have you had any relationship since?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't like the one he was now?	He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Where's your mom?	She died.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, could you close the door?	H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Write her.	You think so?
It's Y. O. H.	Yeah.  What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?	Window.
Do you want a fruit plate?	I don't know.  Do I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad --	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?  About last night?	It's never happening again. Right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not.	My feelings exactly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine.  Fine.	So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.	Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.  I'm just --	Stressed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This one's for both of us.	Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad!	Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.	Oh, right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is she bringing that bag?	She's going to cook something for us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ever do that again.	I thought I saw a black widow spider.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing up?	I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.	The water tastes better in the kitchen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, she's beautiful.	Victoria? She's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen my wallet?	It might be in the kitchen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe you flew first class.	It was all they had.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.  Sam?
Yes?	You must be Jonah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a little derivative.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyway, Victoria's nice.	Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Mornin'.	How's it going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You haven't tried locking them up!	You want 'em all arrested?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got any more ideas?	I don't make policy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take a drink. Calm down!	I say we gotta take action. Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How goes it?	It never ends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mama, can I put the candles ...	Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are they singing, Mama?	They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?	Yes. We will light the candles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going?	Got to talk to the brothers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This water's cold again.	I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!	Never... never... never!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
A fighter, huh?	He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.	He'll have it good. Some day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to have a talk, you and me.	All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
A meeting?	Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.

You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My sentiments exactly.	Why are you doing this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.	Don't we always take good care of you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're in business.	Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Bubba?	Maybe he isn't showing.

Good luck, John.	Thank you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, where are you from?	You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.	Figured.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That must be four thousand yards.	Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, that's Ryan.	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	Of course, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He ain't half-bad, I guess.	I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He ain't Wade.	Nope, he ain't Wade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.	Like hell, you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No kiddin'?	What deal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.	I'd love to hear it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	In the shadow by those two trees.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watching.	Gives Wade the second shot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet.	Keep trying.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	A machine gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder where they're going.	Same place we are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.	You don't count.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.	Those guns are close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, what about our deal?	I changed my mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worked, didn't it?	You tryin' to get yourself killed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get a translator, Captain?	I've got a line on one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, Captain...	PUSH!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?	It doesn't take this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?	How about I go right, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about...?	How about you shut up and take your position?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You alright?	Let's just find someplace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.	You're welcome, John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, oh.	Out of the mouth of babes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, can I ask you a question?	Sure, Reiben.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!	Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.	We can't leave it here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.	Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.	HERE THEY COME!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...	Get back to your positions!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What deal?	I coach the baseball team, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	Alright, come with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You set?  Sarge nods.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.	Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, sir.	Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I usually like surprises.	What are we likely to run into?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn fool.  Sir.	Captain, he's fast!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, where are you from?	Get lost.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think he really believed it?	Who knows?  It worked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How fast?	Twenty-four-five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep it.	You're sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lloyd?	Hey, sis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're tough, J-man.	He's a mess!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be in my office.	I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, don't go in there.	Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what's love?	I'm gonna call her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you sleep with her?	I admit nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does it say?	Read it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.	Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lloyd is doomed.	Meaning?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lloyd, it's us.	Look at his face, he did the deed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lloyd, she's being difficult.	I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you love him?	I like him a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, are you okay in there?	Just finishing up in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank-you.  The real world.	Look at those eyes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa.	Would you hold this for me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So we can finally talk?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He does this every year?	It's the worst job since keymaster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have a good sleep.	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Or, or I could always wear this one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice one.	Yeah?
I think you should wear that.	You think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop by later.	Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.	I'll see you there.  Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get outta here.  You want to?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm fine.	Okay, good, this is all very noble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're freaking out here man.	You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, I'll give here the message.	Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
What?	She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.	Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks Lloyd.	How do you pay for one of those?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My car.	Your car?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Diane Court.	Dude, I can't do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ooop, excuse me.	How you doin', brother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I was just going to...	A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I was gonna...	Thanks a lot Lloyd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We finally graduated, big dude guy!	Alright!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you man	I love you too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not a charade, all this?	A charade?  How could it be a charade?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Luck.	War.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I stay?	It's a beautiful city.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I stay?	It's up to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, okay, let's talk.	In Breslau.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We started without you.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want these people.	These people, my people, I want my people.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I got for you?	Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like this?	There's nothing in the stores.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.  How's it going?	Things are great, things are great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?	Wine?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pots and pans.	Something they can hold in their hands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.	They should be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ever do that to me again.	Do what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got to go, I'll see you.	Oskar -
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll talk to him.	I think it's too late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four hundred, four fifty -	More.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's very generous of you.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need to talk.	Stern.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They arrived.	They arrived, can you believe it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll talk to you later.	No, no, what, what is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?	He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you checked the...	Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I would say we are now officially baffled.	On national television.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	What is it?
I heard a noise.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...	Stop it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Outside.	That's smart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do that. Hang up...call...	What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...	I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...	Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Who is this?
Cici. Who's this?	Someone who wants to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello? Ted?	No, it's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHAAAATT?	Don't forget to set the alarm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?	I live here.
I thought you were going to the mixer?	I had to change. Did anyone call?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.	Its over, Cotton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	Finish what my son started.
But youll never get away with it.	Enter Cotton Weary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you put up with this Greek shit?	Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My documentary is due on Tuesday.	What's your subject?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.	Sid, you don't have to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About what?	The forbidden subject.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme take you home.	I'll get my jacket.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is exactly what I don't want.	I think it's out of your control.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on, untie him.	No. This is a set up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Good question. You took the bait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?	Youre not going to get away with this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two.	So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's got guards with her.	What guy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He seemed harmless.	Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need some help, honey.	I got it..
<EOC>	<EOC>
We had to have financing.	Tuitions expensive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not good. How you doin?	Not good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You broke my heart.	What are we looking for?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?	Can we turn the light on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ssshh! What was that?	Let's find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is all too familiar.	Over here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ!	He filmed his victims.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	No, wait here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dewey?	There's nothing. I'm coming down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is this?	I'll give you one guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	That's not the way we play the game.
I don't play games.	What if your life depended on it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	You're pretty when you're angry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you?	I'm everywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh--a God complex	Stay away from the cop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want from me?	It's what you want from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sid, I'll come with you.	But who would operate your camera?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Oh my God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have rehearsal.	I have to watch rehearsal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He tried to kill her first.	Is Sid in therapy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got a surprise for you.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knock yourself out.	Hello?  Hello?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?	Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?	Gotta.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was good.	Yeah, right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is that guy?	It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.	I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm the only one who can cut him down.	It's not a good idea, Hallie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many guys they have on you?	I counted four.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been waiting for you, baby.	Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And white.	Easy black boy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Gale?
She's not here right now.	But she's standing right next to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it off.	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?	I get scared really easy, okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be right back.	Where you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	Don't panic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.  Hello?	Hello.
Who is this?	Who is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.	There's more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that a threat, Detective?	When it's a threat, you'll know it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Detective Kincaid?	What Rielly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.	The killer called her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.	She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can see nothing's changed.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Gale?	They've got her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.	Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.	He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jennifer needs me.	Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop following me.	I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.	Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.	Fuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.	Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
<EOC>	<EOC>
OH. OH GOD. GALE --	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sidney, what happened?	Nevermind, what'd you two find?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you excuse me for a moment?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's phone?	Oh shit it's my cell!
<EOC>	<EOC>
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!	No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.	Need to get in that building?
No really?	There a story in that building?
Possibly.	Gale Weathers would find a way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody said she was an actor.	Good twist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gale he's got Dewey!	I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!	Let's get out of here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? She asked.	It's called tact, you fuckrag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't kill anybody.	No one's saying you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Owwww...	You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ready to party hard tonight?	You know it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dude. What are you doing here?	I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's on the table.	No, it's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought she was dead.	She looked dead. Still does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She can't get both of us.	Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.	Where the fuck did she go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?	No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Billy? What the...	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?	You sleep in THAT?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My dad's in the other room.	I'll only stay a sec.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Close call.	What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what my dad will do to you?	I'm going... I'm going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, SHIT!	Hey, hey, it's just me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.	It's okay. We need to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wanna let go. I do...	Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sshh... it's okay.	Or even a good porno.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You heard me.	Are you serious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were...	I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
NO! Don't believe him.	It's okay. Give me the gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.	Stop it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Are you alone in the house?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?	What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?	I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.	Do I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
So why did you dial it again?	To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.	Wait, wait, don't hang up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I want to talk to you for a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Why don't you want to talk to me?
Who is this?	You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
I don't think so.	What's that noise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Popcorn.	You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.	I only eat popcorn at the movies.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.	Really? What?
Just some scary movie.	Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.	What's your favorite scary movie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	You have to have a favorite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want to know my name?	Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you say?	I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.	What do you think I said?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to go now.	Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...	Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.	Don't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	I told you not to hang up on me.
What do you want?	To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?	You getting scared?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this some kind of a joke?	More of a game, really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm two seconds from calling the police.	They'd never make it in time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you?	Guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't hurt him.	That all depends on you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wanna play a game.	No...
Then he dies. Right now.	NOOO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of game?	Turn off the light.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know...	Come on, yes you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's his name?	I can't think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael... Michael Myers.	YES!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now for the real question.	NOOOO....
But you're doing so well.	Please go away! Leave us alone!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...please... no...	Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...leave me alone... please...	Answer the question and I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What door am I at?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.	Your call.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?	Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And why is that? Has something happened?	You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.	I don't think you're so bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.	Sidney's father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll call for backup.	I'll get my camera.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does mom know?	Yes, you doofus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?	Hold up a sec...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any word on my Dad?	Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You girls ready.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have they found my father?	Afraid not.
Should I be worried?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.	How is everything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.	Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was first to respond.	What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.	How is she?
She's tough.	Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She staying with you?	We haven't located her Dad yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That fish smelled strong.	I told you to send it back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	What is it? Where's Casey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she?	Call the police.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.	The phone's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Casey! Casey!	Not my daughter... not my...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What?	Jesus! The camera-hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the book?	It'll be out later this year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll look for it.	I'll send you a copy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not here to fight.	Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.	Kenny. Camera. Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Off the record. No cameras.	Forget it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please. You owe me.	I owe you shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're evil.	Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you get this shit?	Ricki Lake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would you call me from my front porch?	That's the original part.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So where are you?	Right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you see me right now?	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hello Sidney.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have a good trip.	Sleep tight, sweetie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stu was with me last night.	Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?	Working, thank you.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.	Twice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.	You got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For about two seconds.	Before she dumped him for Steve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought everything was checked out.	I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's Leatherface doing here?	He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.	Like you had one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.	No, Sid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.	Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are they doing this?	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remember, there's safety in numbers.	Yeah, okay... whatever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.	Why are you doing this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're crazy -- both of you.	"The official term is ""psychotic""."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you believe this shit?	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or a man's mentality.	How do you gut someone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.	Just like old times, ain't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you really think Billy did it?	He was there, Tatum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take a message.	It's alright. I'll get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Sid.	Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, what is he doing here?	I bet he's pissed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.	It was him, Tatum. I know it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?	I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you dumped her for me.	I did. He's full of shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
With that set of lungs -- she should be.	Tits -- see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not necessary.  You're in.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	I'm in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you heard?	No, I haven't heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Already.	Greed.  It was written in blood.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's none of my business anymore.	I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's being arraigned tomorrow.	I read about it in the paper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe it.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's so exciting?	It's not too far away now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time is it?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me the gun.	Her pretty head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't know.	NO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where we headed?	You'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just keep leading the way.	It's close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've made a good life for yourself...	Shut up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here he comes.	What the fuck is going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who said this was murder?	No one yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a bucket here.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a bucket of vomit.	Is there any blood in it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think it was poison?	Guessing at this point is useless.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.	Whoa, whoa... what?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too soon for him.	Can we talk about this in private?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's my wife.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like you to meet Somerset.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You go to movies at least?	I read.  Remember reading?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No fingerprints?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing.	It's got to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck is that?	A switchblade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There must be something.	We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Bear with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!	Just wait!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would we?	Satisfy our curiosity?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is Victor.	Call an ambulance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much money do you have?	I don't know... like fifty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that was money well spent.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait... just wait.	It was him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think about it...	What the fuck is wrong with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stupid son of a...	No point in arguing anymore...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	We had him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You knew I'd say yes.	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.	Big surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because he is John Doe, by choice.	When do we get to question him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay with him.	Wait!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Throw your gun down now!	What are you talking about?  What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me it's not true.	I can't let you do this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put your gun down!!	Don't do this... please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything... anything missing or different.	I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?	I can't do this now... please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This painting...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.	It surprises me.  It really does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have you lived here?	Too long.  What do you think so far?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did their son see it happen?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's California?	How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...	That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lucy's going on seventeen now...	An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...	What, Ben?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get along...	Why don't you finish the job?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you saw wasn't Lucy.	It was, I tell you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.	I ain't wearing no gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another one, eh?	This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?	No sir...pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right, sergeant?	Dunno...Seems so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...	Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't goin'...	He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.	Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He cometh forth like a...	Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What good does that do?	By what you preach...none!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got any more orders, Captain?	Just keep goin'...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What in...?	Captain Clayton...Captain!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?	I'm Clayton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!	Grab hold!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...	They have done...nothing...They are my people...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.	Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you come by this?	You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.	You got it with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.	Ain't yours yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you want me to call you?	Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing for you to see.	Leggo...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right, Ethan?	Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?	Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you goin' to do?	Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night...Laurie...	Good night...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...	YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Futterman?	He just couldn't wait...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...	Scar?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ethan, quit it!	Nine...  Ten!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you're a widower now...	What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...She's not...	I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme alone...	You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay out here.	Not likely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How? She's even forgot her own language!	Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on! Get out of here while you can...	Over there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll be back...	We won't be here...Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that got to do with us?	What's goin' on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.	I got your boy killed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not a little girl any more.	You've seen her!...She's alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?	That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go takin' that stuff...	Ain't worth the mendin'...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why else?	Come on, say it.  You know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to cut his windpipe...	You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellen, move aside...	Oh God, Tommi...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop that!	You'll never get away from me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey... the fuse.	Oh, damnit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Making our very own solstice fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?	I just had a really strange experience.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that?	Someone from the village.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, did you sleep good?	Yeah... I have to go to town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where have you been?	In the village.  Look what I found.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	I haven't the slightest idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?	Hi, darling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you get me out of there?	I wouldn't have made it by myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For God's sake, what happened to me?	You don't remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.  Can I help you?	Does this dog here belong to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellen Straub.	It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
Do I look like it that much?	Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't tell her!	We should leave the past alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, look here!	"Ladies and gentlemen: The ""Straub country-residence""."
<EOC>	<EOC>
NedI knowI know	It's good.
Oh	The title won't do.
Ah	Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are a gentleman.	And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Follow that boat!	Right you are, governor!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know that house?	Sir Robert De Lesseps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, my lady!	Lady?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have no Juliet!	No Juliet?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We will all be put in the clink.	See you in jail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you writing?	A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
What is the chief part?	Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?	Romeo
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.	It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
How much?	Ten pounds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long has it been?	A goodly length in times past, but lately
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.	Who is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.	Yes, I saw it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have a wonderful new play!	Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.	Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!	And his ears.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!	Partners!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the title?	Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is the play?	Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it going well?	Very well.
But nothing is happening.	Yes, but very well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!	Nobody knew!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No Juliet?!	it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?	Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know it?	Every word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	To my weekly confession.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now where? Will?	To the Palace at Whitehall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel a scene coming on.	Is it about a pirate's daughter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!	Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cut round him for now.	What? Who?
Romeo.	The one who came with your letter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are lost.	No, it will turn out well.
How will it?	I don't know, it's a mystery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kit	How goes it, Will?
Wonderful, wonderful.	Burbage says you have a play.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck with yours, Kit.	I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.	A different one you haven't written?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Good morrow, cousin."""	"""Is the day so young?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Out."""	"""Of love?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not ready? Where is she?	Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be good to her, my lord!	I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God bless you!	Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your Majesty.	Stand up straight, girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And--?	And I love poetry above all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your Majesty!	Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"""	"""Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"""	"""What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you, master?	I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.	I have to get back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My lady!	Who is there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my lady, my love!	If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.	Oh, not for the world!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you love a fool?	Can you love a player?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do not know how to undress a man.	It is strange to me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You would not leave me?	I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Moonlight!	No, the morning rooster woke me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, do not go	I must. I must
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Will!	Yes, some of it is speakable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will! What--?	A literary feud. Quite normal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But all ends well.	How does it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My lady Viola.	My lord.
I have spoken with your father.	So my lord? I speak with him every day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take off your hat.	My hat?
Where did you learn how to do that?	I . . .
Wait there.	Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's his name?	I don't know -- Campbell or something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, just a few questions.	I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?	Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He made it clear.	Why, thank you, David.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Think about it.
No.	Come on, David.
No.	Juliet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's still here.	He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?	You call them if you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finished.	But not quite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you worry about that.	Is this necessary?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was good.	Can we talk about something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the problem?	I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.	Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much did you pay?	I don't know.
How much did you pay?	I don't know.
How much?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this?	Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?	There was a break-in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's all this for, more security?	I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? Yes, that's fine.	You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.	What's wrong?
Nothing.	You're not eating.
Not eating what?	Not eating like you used to, that's what.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	Your friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, can't think of anything else that matters.	About the mail --
It's very kind of you to offer, but --	Where do you think you'll go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it, then.	That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.	Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cameron.	Cameron?
Yes.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you know --	Just serve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aroused and inflamed.	Alex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not usually drunk.	Not usually this drunk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen Hugo?	No. Any idea which channel he's on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder how he did it?	Did what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Alex. It's, it's --	What?
Unfeasible.	Is that all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.	But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.	And now you tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sshh.	I want my money back. Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Love and happiness for ever.	For ever and ever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look over there. It's Cameron.	Who?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.	No, I don't.
What's he doing here?	That's not him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you certainly had a good look around.	You were magnificent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you calm down.	Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this the same stuff you made last week?	No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.	It tastes different.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, am I glad to see you.	What are you doing here?
We have to talk.	Your painful groin?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Expecting anyone?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you going to answer it?	Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --	We were just sorting things out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It makes us feel a whole lot better.	That's what I thought he said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.	Let him go. Let him take it all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Interesting.	I see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, uh...	What?
What?	You were going to say something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's OK. There's no problem.	You mean I can have the room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you afford this place?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this where no one stays?	Yeah, that's right, that's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I've never seen them.	You're sure of that.
Yes.	That wasn't a question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want a room here?	Do you smoke?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just get on with it, Alex.	Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this what they always look like?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never seen a dead body before.	Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Would you like to talk about it?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know many of these people?	Yes. They're my friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Expecting anyone?	What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?	No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?	No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?	No one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you'd gone to work.	With a face like this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	I should hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We already know. All about it.	It was on the television.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So let's go.	You and me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	And you need your sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	What happened to that guy?
What guy?	That guy, the one that died.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What guy that died?	That one, last week.
Here?.	Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Oh, him. Well, he died.	That's what I thought.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must be Hugo.	You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?	I'd be delighted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's nice.	Would you like to see the rest?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was some guy called Brian.	Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?	It's an improvement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Working nights?	I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?	No. But he needs treatment.
For what?	A certain weakness.
The human condition.	You know about it?
I write about it?	And that's not the same thing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take all the time you like, doctor.	I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Offering it for debate.	It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can tell by the intonation.	One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your watch.	Is it real?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyway, you remember Harold?	Yeah, baby, how's it going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think George is a fairy?	Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.	Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --	Lester, don't you think that uhh --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lester.	Yes, sweetheart, shh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We cannot go into this later.	That's okay too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late, George.	I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to talk about it...	But you don't know what happened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George --	I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can see that.	You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?	Whatever you say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is she all right?	I don't know. Just a minute...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hello, George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comb my hair out later, honey.	No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But aren't you...	Right now, I just don't care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no.	... what?...
That headboard.	Nobody can hear it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You going to answer it?	Uh-uh.

<EOC>	<EOC>
That sounds like me.	I am you, you little bastard.

I have to see you.	Hey, stop by the shop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me!	I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Go where?	Egypt!
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?	Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jill says nothing.	Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.	Who?
Never mind. Where've you been?	A business meeting, I told you that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does he direct besides traffic?	Ha, ha.
Television or movies?	Commercials.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, Jackie --	-- she's a very compulsive girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got to get her out of here.	-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --	-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come you took your own car?	I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.	What is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did fuck him, didn't you?	I'm very tired, George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't you, baby?	Let go of me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was him.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- and take this with you.	Where did this come from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?	Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... well I'm glad you told me.	Jesus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What? What? What? What?	... honest. At least you're honest with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.	Well, yeah.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's an unusual trade.	Yes it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But the important thing is you're successful at it.	In a way. But...
But what?	I'm better than the guy I work for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?	Oh yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, honey, I...	That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Well anyway...	Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This really ought to be layered...	Layered?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You live like a pig.	Yeah.  How long have you been here?
All night.	Well... who are those guys?
What do they look like?...	Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.	Well, what?
Godammit, George...	Now wait a minute...
Sit down.	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wanna hear about it.	Oh Jesus Christ.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a drink?	No thanks.
Have a drink.	Okay, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't have a clean glass in the house.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really think so?	Yes I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What took you so long?	Wasn't sure it was you.
All right, who're you with? Jill?	No.
Awww --	I'll call you back.
Come on by.	I'll call you back...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're lying about one thing, Lester.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut the door, shut the door!	Oh, I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They get hair all over the place.	They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here.	Aren't you going to have one?
No.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, doll, what's wrong?	You know what's wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jackie Shawn.	Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
<EOC>	<EOC>

I'm not. Maybe I am.	No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.	Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. thank you.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm terribly sorry.	-- never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?	-- no.
Good for you.	He's a hairdresser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George? Was he alone?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That bastard.	George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --	-- oh I don't know --
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- why?	-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- so when are you going to Egypt?	You mean when are you going to Egypt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.	Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?	You're going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- what's the problem, honey?	-- his car. They have it blocked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- I'll get in the back --	-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --	That's fine --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?	Jill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- yes, Jill.	Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.	-- just wonderful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You seem disappointed.	No... how long did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	John...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll let you know tomorrow.	Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.	Have they sat down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No of course not.	-- we're going to be here all night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me Les.	Where to, Les?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?	Yes?
I'm hungry.	Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.	What was the Donner party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going, Doc?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  I'm just a little tired.	Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.  I have too much to do.	Dad?
Yes?	Do you like this hotel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?	What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?	French Fries and Ketchup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like ice cream, Doc?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chocolate.	Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you want to talk about it?	I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?	Tony.
Who's Tony?	Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	How does he tell you things?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe he showed me something.	Try to think what it was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No I ain't.	Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Danny, come on over here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Okay.  You behave yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Danny?	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red Rum.	Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.	Are you having a bad dream?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy...	Danny, come here!

<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy!	Oh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we go into the living room?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What sort of injury did he have?	Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Won't keep you a moment, sir.	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Grady?	Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.	That's right, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.	Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?	A nigger.
A nigger!	A nigger cook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.	Grady... oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Glad to meet you, Winifred.	Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, we don't mind.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill, how do you do?	Pleased to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's my credit in this joint anyway?	Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's good to see you.	It's good to be back, Lloyd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No charge?	Your money's no good here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, babe.	Hi, hon.  How's it going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perfect for a child.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.	What time is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eleven thirty - Jesus!	I guess we've been staying up too late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any ideas yet?	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want me to do about it?	Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you find anything?	No, nothing at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's still asleep.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody did that to him.	I think he did it to himself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get him out of here?	Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack!	How do you like it?
<EOC>	<EOC>

As soon as possible.	Jack...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course I am.	Of course you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?	Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay away from me!	Why?
I just want to go back to my room.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!	I'm not going to hurt you.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Very nice to meet you.	Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe they did.	Well, my predecessor in this job

Can I tell you kids something?	Sure, Uncle Al.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. Go away.	Let me help you up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, Uncle Al.	Will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!	Jane-
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something else scary.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been hearing noises in there.	What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.	Rats...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom-!	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a pilot's license, Marty?	Do I need one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED	What you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But how?	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
I think I hear it!	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
<EOC>	<EOC>
LET THY SPIRIT	You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT	I think they hear you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's... dreamy.  He's...	Yes, Mary?
<EOC>	<EOC>
SING!	Were you tempted?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I'm fearful!	SING!
And I'm tearful!	SING!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you doing.	Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
His ashes?	With love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Christy -- strip.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.	I love my heddles.  Show me again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That machine.	I know.  It's ancient.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, Mary?	That man -- who is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry, Sister!	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE	It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE	What a shame!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS	Pay attention...
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!	Were you wicked?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shirelles.	You know that song?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Soprano or alto?	Whatever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence, are you with us?	Um, I don't really know this one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'll be hell.	Tell me about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's a pro.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Van Cartier.	You know?  About me?  About everything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
JUST SING!	Sing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, we're late.	What?  What time is it?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.	Five a.m.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, then there's only one thing to do.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence!	Now you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bobs	Experience!  Right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting experience.	You watch yourself!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence!	Keep moving!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamn it!	Mary Clarence!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my Lord!	Experience!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you leaving us?	Oh no.  We'll always be together.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?	They're from my old convent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Run!  Take off!	Again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence!	Bless you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Van Cartier.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And the vow of chastity.	I'm outta here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this all the food I get?	Yes.  Until breakfast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.	My what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!	Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But... wait a minute...	The majority has spoken.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sent for me?	You have a phone call.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	Saving you.  Move!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.	Oh?
You saved my life.	I'm a Christian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And if I don't?	Then-you run.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean -- worried about my testimony?	No -- worried about you.  Personally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vince knows you're here.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing?	Even nuns have to pee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could put you into our witness protection program.	A hiding place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then one day they find you.	They open a window.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're looking for Mike.	You found him -- but we're not open yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you didn't tell me!	We didn't tell you what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A nun?	I'm telling you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vince -- is she... okay?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And if she runs?	Take care of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.	It's a bluff, Vince.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's done?	Not... totally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	It didn't work, Vince.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.	So, take it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get her!	Which one!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There she is!	Which one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't see anything in here!	Willy -- hit the lights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joey?	Where is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's she doing?	She's praying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It should be here any minute.	Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.	We're losing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to save her!	We can't leave it up to the Feds!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sister Mary Patrick?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?	Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peace on Earth.	However, we can also pray for other things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this like your old convent?	Which convent was that, Sister?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!	That was exciting!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not like other guys.	He's decent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd rather sing than do anything!	It's better than ice cream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.	It's brought people back to the church.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence!  Sister!	It's no use.  She just isn't here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean -- they kidnapped her?	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
<EOC>	<EOC>
An... entertainer?	She wasn't a nun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's so beautiful...	And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!	But how do we get there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?	A Benedictine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!	Christy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not a note.	Impossible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.	But where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reverend Mother?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?	It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	Find 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?	Many have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They spend two days in chains.	Two days... ?  For murder?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you move the body, Doctor?	To place it inside its coffin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No bleeding.	What is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must be a curious sight to him.	What are you spying on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He is a behemoth.	A diseased monster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.	You will stay at her side?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stains of blood.	What of it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is sacrilege!	I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe you should take this.	A fine idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn... damn... damn...	Master Hardenbrook...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?	Well... that might be... helpful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Widow Windsor.	Is that all you say?  Look at her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is the common thread between these victims?	I'm sure I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going?	Up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Out there.  What do you see?	The Western Woods.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you familiar with magnets?	What kind of nuts?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's spectacular.	Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
No, I couldn't...	I have others.  All I need is this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Listen.
I hear nothing.	No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are leaving.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should not go much further in this murk.	Should we go back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Stay back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Climb up!	Lady Van Tassel...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can we do?	Take the reins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?	I doubt that's the end.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you?	Tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forgive me, I didn't know.	I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Blood.	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Just... keep where you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What... what are you doing... ?	I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is so urgent?	Come with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going?	I do not know.  Away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The church.	He moves too fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	His horse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ichabod...	Keep climbing.  I will follow...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know you saw me.	What... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cannot kill what is already dead.	Let her go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There was not much blood, was there?	I didn't see none.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?	Yes.  Here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What... what are you doing?	Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.	Doctor, he is awake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He rides tonight.	Father saw you die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hit ain't got no gas in it.	See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I help you?	I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?	You have any biscuits for sale?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?	Karl's my name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure, I guess.	Don't rush ever'body, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.	I thought I told you to keep out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I guess.	Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.	Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You walk fast, don't you?	I reckon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A blister shore can hurt.	Yeah.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.	Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm ye boy.	I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.	I ain't got no boy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karl, you up?	Yes sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?	Tolerable, I reckon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You scared me.	I didn't aim to.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?	No ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He just got out of the state hospital.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's just go, Marsha.	No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.	Why won't he talk to women?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?	It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, man, how's it going?	Hi, Auggie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.	Five thousand bucks.
And you're giving it to me?	It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?	For keeps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's just one thing I want to know.	Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it hurt?	Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thomas.	Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah? Who is it?	It's me, honey. It's Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.	Yeah? And why is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?	Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?	Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?	Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.	Here, catch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.	Good. I'm glad that's settled!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, kid.	Wow. They sure did a job on you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.	It's all right. I really do know them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you want that cooked?	Medium rare, please.
Fries?	Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?	Yes, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	You don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We discussed that.  And decided not to.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Question withdrawn, you may step down.	You're implying th...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My mom.  Would be the problem.	Why?  We're only talking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can just feel my spirits soar.	Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you write that column?	I did.  But the jury won't s...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Greedy.	He didn't want to lose any more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have the night watch?  On the radio.	Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long you have this detail?	Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did.  Boy.	Three kids.  What's she going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said three minutes.	Won't take two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?	Have a look.  At nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gonna climb that with one arm?	You're right.  I better use two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the way it happened, I know it is.	No, you don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This tastes horrible, hmmn?	You're wondering why I held it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.	Yes, he was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's when he fell.	Fell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cigarette?	I'll take two.  One for later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't let go, you s...	It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What for, Sheriff?	We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You always run with the well open?	I was checking the cables.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must think I like losing.	I think you like learning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to say that.	I want you.  To tell the truth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For certain, no.	But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you absol...	<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...	That's all he said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which of you dolls is Daphne?	Bull fiddle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I beg your pardon.	All right, girls - from the top again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.	Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.	It's entirely mutual.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Upsy-daisy.	Fresh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?	It's private.  Go away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	Manhattans?  This time of night?
<EOC>	<EOC>
- so the one-legged jockey said -	What did he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?	I'll say.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?	Yeah.  Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nellie told us about it.	We're not too late, are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we running, Joe?	As far away as possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is Josephine.	And I'm Daphne.
<EOC>	<EOC>
DAPHNE?	I never did like the name Geraldine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not there - that's the emergency brake.	Now you've done it!
Done what?	Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.	You better come help me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This way, Daphne.	Now you tore the other one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Men?	Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Daphne.	Good night, Josephine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -	It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.	Don't get burned, Daphne.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know - the old shell game.	Daphne, you're bothering us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.	You can both go take a flying jump.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's some nerve!	Daphne got a proposal tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
OH!	Terribly sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are my seams straight?	I'll say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Sugar.	Good night, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And that's one of them.	Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	I'm fine.
How's the bottle?	Half-full.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who needs vermouth?	We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And bring the cocktail shaker.	Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not you, Sugar.	I'm just going to get some ice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll carry the instruments.	Thank you, Daphne.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.	Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brand new.	This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you girls play before?	Oh - here and there - and around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did those holes get there?	Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?	Yes.  For a whole year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was it.	What's the big idea?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's about the Florida job.	The Florida job?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with us?	You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could pass for that.	- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.	- and you got to be girls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a moment, miss -  May I?	Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.	I am Cinderella the Second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.	Goodbye?
This is where I get off.	Oh, you don't get off that easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please.  It won't happen again.	No, thank you.  I'll walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daphne...	Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another bridesmaid?	Flower girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like no witnesses.	We won't breathe a word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the job?	It's three weeks in Florida -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?	Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, we couldn't!	William Morris!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, here we are.	You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happened?	Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I guess I'd better go -	It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?	If it's at all possible -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Josephine.	Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The most wonderful thing happened -	What?
Guess!	They repealed Prohibition?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.	I am?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.	Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Champagne?	I don't mind if I do.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.	Bon voyage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that anything?	Thanks just the same.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well - ?	I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.	Me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?	I told you - I'm not very bright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.	If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perfect. All ginny.	Except its Scotch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I dont think I can go through with this.	Pub Golf?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should get going.	Are you sure youre okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fred Astaire and whats her face!	Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.	What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was such a long time ago.	Still--
If Ed ever found out....	Or Kat....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Kat know?	Jeffrey told her last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wheres Nick sleeping?	Why, with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.	Oh, dont be that way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you said you were crap.	I had to say something to get you here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I look like a total wanker, dont I?	Yeah, kind of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You heading to the train station?	I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whats his problem?	What?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.	Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didnt deserve her back then.	And you do now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing.	Doesnt look like nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Oh, hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, a philosopher.	Shrink, actually.
Crikey.	What?
Nothing, nothing.	No, tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, man.	Sorry, can you give us a moment?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.	Hello, Katmandu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seeing you again....	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Kat.	Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?	I have regrets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. Hey.	Kat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What color are my shoes?	You have feet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mission accomplished.	Really?  Dont get too attached.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?	Love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, count it, anyway.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are they?	Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Its cute.
What is?	You stand on your tiptoes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever done anything like this before?	A weekend?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you grab my shampoo?	Shampoo, got it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?	I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dont stop asking questions, okay?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I swear. I dont have a signature move.	Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Subtle?	I disappear. Its not about me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Its hard to explain.	Show me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this for last night?	Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What would you do if you weren't an escort?	Make out with you for free.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. You?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?	I didnt say he was worth it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should go.	What?! No, no. You cant--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whats he do anyway?	Therapist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no. He told you.	You knew?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad!	Hi, kiddo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So whyd you let him go?	Its complicated, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet...	...but its getting there. 
<EOC>	<EOC>
I always wondered what happened with us.	I havent thought about that in years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!	I try...
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you say all them people is dead now?	That's right--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.	What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois.	What he talk 'bout?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But, Charlie --	NO! N-O, NO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?	Yes, sir...

<EOC>	<EOC>

Be good and be smart, little boy.	Yes, ma'm...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.	Come in, children.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's about the Three Musketeers.	Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
When you read it we'll talk about it...	Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .

Oh, you are such a maroon!	You would know, dummy.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!	You did? Just now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
AGH!	Terrance! NO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!	Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!	Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.

Hey, I'm missing the party!	No! It can't be!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!	That's nice, Stan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see that, Wendy?	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah!	This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Wendy.	Hi Stan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
NAZIS!!	What's the matter, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.	God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wendy?	Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stan! Stan are you okay?!	Wendy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't have watches?	Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.

Got it.	And ze rope?
Check.	And the butfor?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God, what is he doing?	He's shutting off the air!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Getting drunk is no solution.	Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...	Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...	Oh Sara...
Anna...	Anna...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, come on!	They're not going to make it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evening.	It can't be.
Excuse me?	You're Warren Wayne.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what are they doing now, Mac?	They are awaiting further information.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On channel 10?	The device has stopped responding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.	My...wings...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you say to me?	It's a little late for you to be up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All too well, captain.	Well shut it off at once!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta think of your old age.	That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?	Uh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!	Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If anyone can hear me please respond!	That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?	Taylor, you surprise me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Idiot...	Good help is hard to find...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's time we lock coordinates.	I know, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what are we waiting for?	Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to die.	Will you shut up already?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's getting hard to breathe...	Just don't move around too much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we going to do?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't.	Well maybe there's a way out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
OK...it's open.	Seen one like it before?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.	Great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And suppose you couldn't hold out?	Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He certainly is polite.	Close every door behind you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone just stay put.	Wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what we're facing.	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready?	Ready as I'll ever be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.  We did it.	So we did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're ready for the real thing?	At this point I'm ready for anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.	Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Taylor?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.	Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dawn!  Dawn!	Helllp!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take this flare.	A flare?  A flare won't do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not going with you.	What?  What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dawn.  Come in.	Taylor!  Where are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm in the bridge.	Barnes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing?	We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!	We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So close...	And so far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you marry me?	Marry you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?!	I don't know.  Wave to them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carlo!	He's in the bathroom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going back for Taylor!	Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...	Send it back if you don't want it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that?	The engines!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?	Mac.  What's shaking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is it looking, Mac?	I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it safe for human transport?	That's affirmative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm looking for a man.	What kind of man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?	No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.	What do you want with old man Faz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, basement bingo.	Lemme see your ball.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.	You afraid we're gonna steal it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three whips. To go.	When you get a chance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you still here?	We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.	Are you guys bruddas?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you turn this thing off?	Wait! That's an aria!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look like you're something on the lanes.	Theo's bowled on the tour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get this ball?	It's mine.
Who gave it to you?	Grace Skinner.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?	She's my mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you? Who sent you here?	I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know no Grace Skinner.	You knew her. You married her in 1963.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Theo.	Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck is this?	What's it look like to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We ain't married no more.	He says that to all his wives.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The whole world thinks you're underground.	I am underground.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knock-knock.	Who's there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.	Who's there?
Junior.	Junior who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.	Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fantastic! What talent.	You still got the touch Junior.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go near the bowling alley.	"Bowling ""Center""!"
<EOC>	<EOC>
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.	She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!	Yippy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get that outta your mouth!	They suspended me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do those two work for your dad or mine?	Mine, and they never tip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I cut in?	No, not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.	Really? I kinda like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do about your brother?	You're here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then it's true, isn't it? About...	...lane six. Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you get this thing down?	Tell me what happened Theo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?	If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
He's dead Sheila.	I feel sick.
You should.	Are you sure he's dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!	Tell your little pal to let go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very good, busyboy.	Dwarf bowling's illegal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Your civil rights have been overridden!	Open it, Captain!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?	They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fletcher, get away from there...	It's burning...
Get out of there!	I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!	I can't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's heat coming the door.	Back away then.
Wait a minute --	I said back away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold on --	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.	How about I just press the button?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Norman!	Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They told me about sixty hours.	Two and a half days?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody move.	But she's --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Direction's east coming!	What was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	He's right beneath us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Increase positive pressure!	That's our reserve air.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it, Norman!	Do you see it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it!	Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Norman, please!  Don't!	Pull it, damn it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Colonel.	Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.	What team?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?	Press?  No, I haven't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They pressurize us with helium.	What's wrong with oxygen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, Norman?	Take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Picked up something?  What is it?	I don't know.  But it's something alien.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we shouldn't.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Like ""Thou shall not kill""?"	Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?	I don't know.  That's the point.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Going active.	Jerry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell?  It shut us down.	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see it.	Pull it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you open that panel?	Working on it now, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.	They're coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any sign of Harry?	Nothing, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing, sir.	What the hell is going on here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	Well, where the fuck is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...	They've left, keep watching!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?	If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how do we get it open?	Ted seems to have some ideas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gimme a report, I want --	Ladies and Gentlemen...
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?	Please watch your closest monitor...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.	It's not ignorant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"With an ""o"".  Harold with an ""o""."	What -- you want me to retype it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd also like it noted --	Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ted, get her away from the door.	What are you going to do -- shoot her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at this.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some sort of lead or something.	Radiation shield, you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	What do you make of this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can he be missing?	Sir, about leaving --
<EOC>	<EOC>
They switched us over.	To what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
From the sphere?	What's inside the sphere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	The sensors are picking up something outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It won't register.  It's too big to image.	Too big?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?	Yeah.  Drowning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're next, Norman.	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Norman!	Get this thing off me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...	Beth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Norman.	What are they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said something to him, didn't you?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beth --	You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.	You bastard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.	Beth --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going in such a hurry?	I have to reset the sub.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.	My air isn't... I'm coming back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still clear?	Still clear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get it straightened out?	I think so, Beth.  Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Page 87.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He translated it wrong.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like some sort of code.	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Diphenyl parlene.	Something for burns.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, Norman?	Where are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	Your watch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, Norman?	I'm feeling better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beth!	You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it coming from, Beth?	Don't you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beth?	Leave me alone, Norman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?  What are you doing?	What?
You hear that?	Hear what?
Get away from me!	Beth --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pussy.	What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Norman?  Where's Norman?	By the bunks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He doesn't wait for an answer.	Who says it's a he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what is it?	It's an American spacecraft.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just in time, too.	In time for what?
What?	Just in time for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you looking at me like that?	Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.	No I'm not.  I'm not star--
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you feeling, Norman?	What?
You holding up alright?	Fine.  I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.	I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead.  Ladies first.	No, why don't --
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon.	Wait a second, I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon, Norman.	Look, would you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our answer.	To what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe that, Harry.	Gimme another explanation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?  That noise?	What noise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... you there?  Norman?	Harry?
Norman, where are you?	I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wisconsin's your answer.	Wisconsin?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.	How do we decode it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the squid!  Stop it!	Stop what?  What are you -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I kill her?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine.	Help me lift her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're never gonna make it.	Shut up and open the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't reach her.	Hold on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Push her, c'mon.	I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Missed.	Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold on.	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You know how to work this thing?	No idea.
Well, press something!	Wait!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.	Nine hundred feet to surface.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She told me what you said, Norman.	What is it, Harry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
English?	That's right.

Good idea, Ted.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Norman Johnson.	Does this mean what I think it means?

Beth and Harry?	They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?	Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?	No, they didn't say --
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wasn't feeling well.	He's a pussy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, he's polite.	Unless it's an act.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was it?	Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?	Not that I know of.  Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.	What?
Was it a military crash?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.	Oh, so you're a warrior then?

<EOC>	<EOC>
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!	But there was a lot of firing earlier...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here come six more... grid two!	Was this trip really necessary?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's the pilot?	It's automatic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found it... It's just not there.	What are you saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't going to work.	Why didn't you say so before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think she's going to be all right.	Not if this tunnel deadends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get to the ship!	Come back here... Where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?	He'll be well cared for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...	Are you there, sir?  We're going...

<EOC>	<EOC>
So what are you doing later ?	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Zander, what are you doing ?	Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good for you.	Your turn...

Johnny Rico, you're jealous !	I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.	I don't even know if you're my girl.

Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...	Who cares ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Carmen.	Shhh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?	Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?	Did you get Starside R&D ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You talk to Carl ?	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna miss you.	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.	Alright, I love you.

Oh, baby, I'm so sor...	IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate her.  I really hate her.	There you are!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No they're not.	Annabelle put down that camera.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!	You owe me a quarter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, this horse smells really bad.	There's worse things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...your hating me.	Cos she loves you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You touched it.	Then have a donut --
No.	Alright starve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me --	Annabelle let's get something clear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you <u>real</u> mad?	How could I be?  We learned some magic...
<EOC>	<EOC>
IS THAT YOU?	IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poof!  You're happy now.	Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?	I knew where I was all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That I do.  Always will.	Mom...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!	Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Pray.  We never find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy's sick, guys.	You have the WORST flu since...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're okay.	I'm still sick, but I'm better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  These are good.	I helped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Find the bird cage?	Rache says it's from you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?	You dying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.	Every day.  More and more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So we'll...radiate some more?	At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's necessary, huh?	Let's take our best shot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Planning on getting --	Remarried.  There is no move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Called him.  We set an ap...	Don't do this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid she's going to walk.	And I'm supposed to care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happens next?	I live or I die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Machines do not EAT message.	Look, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeh?	Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So why did y...	I did it for her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, I just...	Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.	Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, you've never liked me...	Don't flatter yourself.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...	Nobody likes a snoop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I hear the word...	Luke.  Can't live like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...	How would you know <u>anything</u>?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They came out of my <u>body</u>!	See, I know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, I'm undeserving.	Ironic, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So I have to tell you something in confidence...	You're a cross-dresser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moi?	Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you said...?	Beats me.  Ask your mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So.  Hopeful.	It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.	And you said...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...	...go to the park.  In the worst way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My advice to you?  Don't die.	Feeling the pressure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You put filth in my child's mouth.	Aw.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!	Worked.  Like a charm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for coming out.	Neutral ground.  What's up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She likes a Stolie, no ice.	Double.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?	Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't I?	Uh.  You hate my guts?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?	Rache, get out of th...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God.  Are you serious?	I think so...What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's forever you know.	Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just an assignment.	It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're my kids.	Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not gonna die.	I know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a great surpri...	Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we go sit somewhere?	Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you goin'?	I'm gonna get me a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.	Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.	What if he is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.	Oh, yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey. What's up?
There's something I need to talk about with you.	What?
There are some rumors...	Like what?
You know...Stanley...	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No prob. I'm cool.	Thanks, Scoob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marty, ignore him.	He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twinkeys!	Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.	Got a lot of homework?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marty...	You started filling out your college applications yet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was anyone in my room today?	Is everything OK?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	I dunno.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We did the same thing last year also.	How was the class?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?	Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?	What's tomorrow?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?	You know he hated my story also.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck!	I'm going in there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So? How was school today?	The same.
The same. Same as what?	Just the same.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the hell outta here!	Man, it's just, like, conversation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scooby?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
OK.	Tired of this shit...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?	OK!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Vi.	What are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?	Uh huh.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	There's the fence...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the arm?	It's nothing to worry about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it!  Up ahead!	Where does it lead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enjoying the tour so far?	Are you going to kill us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose...you think I should thank you.	Yes, you should.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, drink up.	I don't want any...
I insist...	I said I don't want any, goddammit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Cooper--where is he?	He's in there...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's Ryan Cooper?	I'll let the senator tell you.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Just what the hell is he talking about?	We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?	Moffo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My seven body orifices????	That's right, fella.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, snap out of it, fella!	Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes!	General Schmuck?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go back to sleep, baby.	What did you say, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?	No, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Mister President.	What kind of trouble?
<EOC>	<EOC>
General Schmuck?	Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.	This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.	Do you recognize my voice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I suppose they are, sir.	You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.	Just a squirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What shall we drink to, sir?	To peace on earth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To peace on earth, Major.	Peace on earth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.	I want to talk to General Ripper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.	Admiral Buldike?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.	Roger. One-three-eight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roger, maintain.	Lothar, take your checks now.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Maximum ECM.	Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then this is it.	What?
War.	War?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.	Maximum ECM!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.	Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roger.	Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
They must have made a visual contact.	Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
They can't touch us at this height.	They're moving apart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.	Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?	Ready, Major.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Master safety.	Master Kong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?	Everything still checks out okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd they get you?	In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know he's dead?	Hell, he looks dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's dead, all right.	Listen, give me a shot quick!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"No, look!  It's ""OPE - Recall Mistake."""	Recall what mistake?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure have to hand it to those guys.	What do you mean?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.	Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.	Needs some pizza in his diet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pony's coming here to the corner?!	Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. Later. I don't know.	Yes!

Please?	Look, look, just get off my property.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, I haven't seen you all day.	You could've come over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was that supposed to be me?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, you asshole.	About what?
About things that are important to me.	Like what?

<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck are you talking about?!	Nobody's fucking anybody!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""See what's around you listen to their lies"""	So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?

All of you!	Bank branch!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bank branch!	All of you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me your coat.	Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?	That was the general idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Name dropper.	I just think pictures should say a little something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.	Sure.  Bases Loaded.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurt feelings department.	About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there someplace we can talk?	How about the Rainbow Room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you --	And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, young fellow.	Hello, Mr. deMille.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.	Get out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a minute, you!	Yeah?
You're a writer, you said.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about some evening clothes?	I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.	Tails.  That's ridiculous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.	Come here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't we wait for the others?	Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not on the same floor with Valentino!	Just follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't bend back like that.	It's those feathers.  They tickle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're really going to send it to De Mille?	This is the right day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.	I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?	Where are your...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --	Wipe your feet!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are not dressed properly.	Dressed for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suppose you listen just for a minute -	Madame is waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.
That's what I told them.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is she?	She is upstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Gillis, if you please.	Right with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joseph C. Gillis?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've come for the car.	What car?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got a title?	Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.	Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bring something to drink.	Yes.  Madame.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?	The cameras have arrived, Madame.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It must be the girls. One of the girls.	But which one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he your entertainment for tonight?	He will be. In about five minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A Storm Dragon?	No, a super girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I'd better keep it.	Whatever you say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait...don't leave me in here...	It's for your own protection.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	I'm taking you to the hospital.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.	Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All this talk about love, it's silly.	You don't like me? You hate me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this how?	Terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She said it wouldn't last.	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't love you any more.	Just like that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Before you go...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.	She has hostages.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!	How do I fight it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's right. They'll string her up.	Do you want to come to Argo City?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! Ethan!	Hmmm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.	I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finished your estimate?	Well, there's several ways to go .
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	A passionfruit smoothee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.	I'll drink to that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?	Supergirl?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any theories about last night?	Theories?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I give you a lift?	Oh, no thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.	As brave as my father. As wise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you making:	It's going to be a tree, I think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see, a tree is a living thing.	Can you create life?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can do that.	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There isn't any.	This is all your clothes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She did that deliberately.	She's a beast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you do that?	Must've been a defective puck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your hair looks the same.	It was just a trim.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No thanks. You go on.	You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is he acting so strangely?	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lucy; come back!	Somebody's gotta do something!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you believe in knocking?	Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can I do for you?	I'm Linda Lee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Balefire on you, Selena!	You Scorpios can never take a joke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was meant for me!	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.	For what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it like?	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is inner space?	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Others?	Criminals.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."""	What? Palace? Hardly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zaltar, please help me.	Of course, my dear. What can I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is a way.	I knew it!
But it's impossible.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going to take me back?	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can use the wand.	Better than when I was a child.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zaltar. Use the wand!	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye...	Zaltar!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah? What do you want?	Buddy, are we in trouble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?	Nope.  Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lana Lang. How great to see you.	Clark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You...um...you never got married?	Oh...I came close once.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can never get a way from it.	Old ties are hard to cut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He really was!	Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gee, I always loved porch swings.	Me too. That's why I put this one up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.	Oh. You're going away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh...excuse me, folks...	Kent!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...  Not quite like this.	Mom and I do this all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!	What!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you really know Superman?	We get together sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!	At one o'clock in the morning?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Name?	Gus Gorman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many sugars?	One.  And a half.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gus?	Say what?
The boss wants to see you.	Say who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man, what is this?	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?	That what they call you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, boss.	Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.	I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?	What are you talking about, fella?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And do nothing. Just sit there.	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this blackmail?	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?	Fair's fair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to mess with Superman?	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is she?	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's the other woman?	That's his sister. Vera Webster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no rush.	But the bridge...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What terrific story?	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lots of things...	Tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know you, lady.	But the other night...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How would you know?	Hey, I know a lot of things!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't see anything.	Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?	Where do you usually find a light switch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Superman!	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't! It's out of control!	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
<EOC>	<EOC>
53.	53!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay? Goodbye.	You've got to pick three more numbers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. White, the next number, please?	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
85,000 dollars.	Missing????
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't kiss.	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not his mama either.	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!	Today coffee----
<EOC>	<EOC>
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.	Don't cry, Bubba.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, let's give it a dry run.	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!	Don't bet on it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jimmy, how's the -	Yeah. I'll check.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody been hurt?	So far the hostages are unharmed.
Hostages?	Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	She'll be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lois, I usually do.	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.	Do I detect a note of jealousy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is kinda romantic.	In July???
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.	Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.	What??
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's true. It's true.	Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.	Oh come on, that's ridic -
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to.	Let's go to my place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Oh, hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sleep well?	Never closed my eyes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
. . . Superman?. . . . .	Lois, I really don't see why --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything on it?	Everything on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll miss the battle of the century!	Good. My heart can't take it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.	Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This way Lex.	It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Genius!  --  Lex.	I'll be alright.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.	It's beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Superman! The --	Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!	Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put down Lex Luthor !	Put down Lex Luthor?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?	I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Free!	Free!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So this is the planet Houston . . .	What shall we do now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are master of all you survey.	And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
General --- ?	We must combine our strength.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late. Very late.	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel kind of light-headed . . .	Don't worry, I've got you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh . . . my . . .	Clark. . . !
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gee, I'm really sorry.	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I don't understand.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you mind taking a walk with me?	Absolutely!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.	. . . And  very naïve!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.	Superman gets mail here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think there's an angle.	An angle?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he going to say?	Something . . . wonderful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Our other dinner guest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.	I must have miscalculated. How. . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! He looks . . . normal.	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! Just remember I made you.	You're just an experiment, freako!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's . . . cold. . .	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll all fry.	This wasn't in the plan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am an experiment? I am freako?	I made you, and I can destroy you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Destroy Superman!	Wait! Not yet! Back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!	I am master now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!	Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!	Bunkers!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me?	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom...	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother...	I know son, I know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know where you're headed?	North. It's north
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep warm now.	I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like to.	Well!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are there any more at home like you?	Not really, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	What the  --  !
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop him, Clark!	He may have a gun!

Know what?	You described the exact contents of my purse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I take you to the airport?	Not unless you can fly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Again???	First the pets, Otis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nuts. He made it.	Tough guy, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bet he makes it.	You're on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up.	I didn't say a word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn!  This will get him.	Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the temperature now?	Fifty degrees below and still falling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Krypton!	Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meteorites!	Bingo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're happy, aren't you?	La de da da...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't let me down.	You?! How about me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No news is not good news. Y'know	There was a recipe on the back  --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Why? does he live up here?	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
<EOC>	<EOC>
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?	If you persist, you leave us no choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a ...baby.	What's your name, boy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around	Okay, but...why?  No offense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lois, the kickback story...	Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy now, miss, I've got you???	You've got me? Who's got you???
Do as I say. Let go!	Oh, God! I'm going to die!
<EOC>	<EOC>
With my luck, now it'll rain.	Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What color underwear am I wearing?	Pink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, Otis?	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I broke the man out of prison --	I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment --	I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him this new face.	I...uh...check.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...	Otis...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that real enough for you?	It is for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I still don't get it.	Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ally Jones.	How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.	I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.	And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...does it turn to?	It turns to steaming piss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm...so sorry.	That's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is...	Mister, I don't want to know your name.
I understand.	No you don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can help you.	Not unless you can raise the dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Nicole.	Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.	Was it good?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be back around nine.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?	I'm not sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.	Goodnight, Nicole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is Nicole?  Is she around?	She's resting.  In her room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you been waiting long?	A while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does this mean I can't take a shower?	No.  It should be dry by now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time's he coming home?	When the game's over, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're leaving.	I better get back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Billy.	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.	What do you mean by that, Dolores?
About the Ottos?	Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.	Berries.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.	What's that, Dolores?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what he said, is it?	Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.	Hi, Dolores.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.	No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.	I'll...take it straight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nicole!	It's the truth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he coming over now?  Right away?	That's what he said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nicole?	What, Mason?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?	I object to that form of question. Note that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.	And what was the weather like at this time?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have no questions.	Thank you, Nicole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a room?	Will you be spending more than a night?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean?	People who will help our cause.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have they ever been busted?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You always think you're prepared for these things.	Tell me about it.
How old is she?	Almost three.
Is this it?	Perfect.
Here we go.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
DADDY!!!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.	Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.	You've been retained?
Yes.	Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you a reporter?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was great.	Really?
You're going to blow everyone away.	You mean it?
Of course.	You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What took so long?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you like it, Nicole?	The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?	Very slick.
Do you like the colour?	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The door needs a lock.	Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.	Oh.  I better get some spackle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.	You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.	My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you up to, Nicole?	Nothing.
Nothing good on your T.V.?	As opposed to this T.V.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.	Yeah, right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.	You don't know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you mind your own business!	Hitler!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?	"Is ""he"" inside?"
But of course...	Alone or surrounded?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?	Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's somewhere...	Thanks, I see him...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.	We're on our way there now...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe, give my nephew a drink.	Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not being partial, are you?	No, I'm not.  I'm not!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sidney is a liar!	Who said Sidney?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Susie, I'm sorry if---	Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!	Susan!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Harry.	Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Match me, Sidney...	Not just this minute, J.J....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh huh.	When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Talk to her, Sidney...	Talk to her yourself...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...	- He's got them on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Frank D'Angelo around?	At the bar - Sidney...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?	That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you still keep your key under the mat?	Can you be there by two-thirty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you know who that man is?	Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Yeah!	And he's a perfect stranger to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.	Help me with two minutes of silence!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go home, Sally.  It's late...	I hate to see you like this --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ought to be used to me by now.	I'm used to you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
If that's for me, tear it up!	Take a top coat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Nothing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...	I know you do, Sidney.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!	Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?	You tell him, I stutter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
J.J., if you think -	Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't told him yet...	I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.	Why did you call me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know about the chip?	What chip?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God.	Now listen to me very carefully.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No good.	Let me try mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oww!  Why'd you do that?	You told me to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to do what I say?!	That is one of my mission parameters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!	Of course.  I'm a terminator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Swear.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything.	Cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excellent.	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alriight!!  My man!	No problemo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll deal with the police.	Remember what I said, you can't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drive for a minute.	Where you going?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't have much time.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it dead?	Terminated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will it melt in there?	Yes.  Throw it in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It must end here... or I am the future.	I order you not to!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?	Gimme that Phillips right there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy money!	Where'd you learn all this stuff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Out of the way, John!	No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.	Alright, it!  We need it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got it.  Piece of cake.	Go!  I'll finish here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready to rock?	Ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John, get out of the way!!	SHOOT!!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you.  I always will.	Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kyle, don't go!	There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can it be destroyed?	Unknown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look like handmade shit.	So do you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?	Correct.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The CPU from the first terminator.	Son of a bitch, I knew it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I must be destroyed.	Can you get us in there, past security?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's finally over.	No.  There is another chip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you afraid?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you stand on all this?	On all what?
On Furtwängler.	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does he mean, too correct?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.	But I promised your mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess you admire musicians.	Some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Your manner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You live here, in Berlin?	Yes.
You do shorthand and typing?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I made no deal!	I don't buy that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steve Arnold...	I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If it's too hot, open your tie.	I wish to say something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what that is?	Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?	Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.	So. You wanted to see me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've remembered something else...	Yeah?
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.	He did?
One of your people told me.	One of my people?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And ask him about his private life.	His private life?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Chuck?	Come to the office, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	You're late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.	Alright!
Can you handle it?	It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything else?	A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Uzi 9 millimeter.	You know your weapons, buddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't to that...	Wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great.	You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.	I hate the beige one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not lately.  Did you check messages?	I thought you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.	What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.	That's none of your business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you understand?	Yes.  Don't hurt me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's so much...	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cold?	Freezing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I caught one, back there.	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good field-dressing.	You like it?  It's my first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.	Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?	About where you're from.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bag some Z's?	Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks a lot.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's where we're going.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.  Time to move out.	Fuck you!  Let go of me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?	Good fighters.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?	Someone?
A girl.  You know.	No.  Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So much pain.	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.	It's better that way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...	Kyle...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I bet you're ticklish.	Ticklish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	You'll beg for mercy in a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think I like this.	You're not supposed to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sarah.	We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Cover...our footsteps...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can help you...	Who is in authority here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That stuff's two hours cold.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm so sorry.	Please, don't do that...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pardon me... Miss... ?	Oh, no... you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, I need to explain...	Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's with him?	I don't know... he fell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what to do?	I don't think he's breathing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is nuts.	What <u>is</u> your problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...	Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to be kidding.	What... is... happening... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's got to be a flashlight.	I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you around.	Where are you going?
Home.	How do you know that's the way?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a ladder here.	My hero.  Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll wait.	It's not like anyone could actually open it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is C.R.S.	What's C.R.S.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There goes a thousand dollars.	Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That one did.	... two hundred dollars a toe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never did catch your name.	Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's classic.	Why... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going?	That tall, bright building.  Near there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What exactly do you do?	Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice.	Hm?  Oh, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	Can we talk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.	Come here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want anything to drink?	You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're watching.	Wha... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  I'm sick of this...	Nicholas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this!?	God, wake up, it's a con!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you say?	I didn't say anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...	Who the fuck cares?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	What do we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.	What... what do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you <u>doing</u> here?	I'm back from the dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get us out of here...	Nicholas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get that... ?	... what... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't move, you bitch... !	I have to show you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
For you.	You shouldn't have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me you'll call.	Okay.
Will you?	I said I would...
But, will you?	Are you still on mediction?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me where we're going.	Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?	Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did those... ?	You're part of it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll explain someday.	I hope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.	I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't need me...	Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been so lonely.	I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.	Don't take another step.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...	Have we met?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.	The key?
Hm?	Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?	No, you didn't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Have a nice day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dinner's in the oven.	Thank you.  Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What makes you ask?	I'm not sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight.  See you home.	Goodnight.  Where was she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your ex-wife.	I know who she is.  Take a message.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Under the Bleachers""... by Seymour Butts."	Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck... ?!	Why are you following me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything wrong... ?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Attractive...	Don't ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happened...	Follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How concerned should I be?	It was a misunderstanding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?	You're joking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hasn't called back.	What about the house?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...	Attempted murder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.	Greetings fellow insomniac.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I only saw Theo drive up.	Who's Watts?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?	I did okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.	Greetings.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That could have been worse.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Luke, can I talk to you?	Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And those are Luke's and mine.	There's a carriage house around back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that the question of compassion or science?	It's a question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not going to hold your weight.	Just stay there, Nell!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  I heard screaming...	Luke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nell --	-- how much is this car worth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was sure she'd be in here.	Where in the hell can she be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you working with her?	Mary, I'll meet you outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All the carvings.	But there's a sad catch to the story.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nell!  What's wrong?	That smell... oh, God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hmm.	I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.	No --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what he's really upset about?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.	How'd I know it was for you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?  What's this... this picture?	That?  That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?	Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have either of you seen David Watts?	No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well this is a cozy breakfast.	Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe they're Mary's.	Mary came with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get a blanket!	It's okay... we're all here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, we can't get out!	Nell, what do we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there something about the house?	Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's where she hanged herself.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?	I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeez.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Theo.	You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it over?	No, it's getting worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never had a pedicure before.	Well?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you come back for, babe?	Just had to be sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Italian?	I'm sorry.
Italian.	Who?
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like the colors.	We all did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.	I'm a gracious host.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We think someone is here.	We think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Come over here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How they goin', kid?	Not bad.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can take care of the paperwork.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man knows what he likes.	Lookin' good.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.	What'd you call that -- the Protector?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Edward Rama?	Eduardo.  Rama.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't expect anyone.	No reason.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?	Round about, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who done it, then?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Not at all.  Do we?	Not me, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's so fucking funny?	Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we standing on?	Faith.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Reminds me of Jennifer.	Hard to miss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Had a feeling it was you.	You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.	Not her brand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you come here?	Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.	Try calling me again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.	Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I would have preferred staying home, me.	You're a reluctant traveller, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Been away a lot.	Where else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much.	Five thousand.
Hey.	I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?	Yeah.
Which kind?	The forever kind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.	Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.	Lemme break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's expecting you?	I doubt it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Valentine here?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've made it ... brighter.	I don't want you here, Terry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of trouble are you in?	No trouble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.  You, too.	Be seein' you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Ed.	Ann. Will you come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm so sorry about your loss.	Yes. Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Rachel.	I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was deaf when he wrote this.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Mr Crane.	Hello, Birdy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	We've certainly missed you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure... Sure, it's his house.	That's what he keeps telling me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I guess I've been all wet.	But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I wanted to make you happy.	Birdy--
<EOC>	<EOC>
...No, please.	Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You are ze fahzer?	No. Uh... family friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Mm.	Well? How'd she do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...she can go up there.	Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Was that a pass?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No problem!	Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You bring a check?	Cash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How ya doin', Ed?	OK. Take your coat, Ann?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Were you in the service, Ed?	No, Dave, I wasn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?	Specialty store down in Sacramento.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Ed, I...	What is it, Dave?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, Ed.	But it's...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your place?	I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Dave?	Come on in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rye.	Just coffee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, get ready. It's important.	Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...What a knucklehead.	Who?
Dave.	How's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.	So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*	Mm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...What's so damn strange about that?	I didn't say a word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey.	How are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what's going on. I--	What happened to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I... should I tell you why?	You don't have to tell me anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Doris--	Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
OK, how did you know?	I... just knew. A husband knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffee, Ed?	I'm fine. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ed, how're you holding up?	I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was quite something.	He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.	I know who you are, Mr Crane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.	Sorry, I just didn't remember.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You sure, Eddie?	Yeah, yeah--go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...How you today, Ed?	OK.
You don't got a headache?	...Nah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...We goin'?	Huh? No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't understand.	He's the dead guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Birdy... I didn't mean to--	What'd he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Lo, Ed.	Hello, Walter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr...?	Crane. Ed Crane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm Crane.	My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello!	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	Could you come with me please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's a barber.	Ah.
Second chair.	Not an owner.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.	Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say? Does he understand?	He said OK. Is that what he said?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.	Great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.	I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.	Anything missin'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget it!	Calm down.  I found it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Battery's dead.  Shit.	Let's go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ippolito!  Get back here!	Like hell!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The body?	What's left of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need light in here, stat.	Where's the head?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.	Whose footprints?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you don't mind, this could be important.	You're kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!	This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.	The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look.  It's some kind of letter.	May I see that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lieutenant!  It's me.	What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!	Got my hands full here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's still back there!	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.	Oh shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	All right everybody, hold up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?	I'd say we're in its home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Curious.  There's something missing.	The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Margo, these aren't seed pods.	What are they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?	Don't stop now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm coming with you.	No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come back and get me.	We will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Frock?	Look who's here, Margo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Footsteps!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not supposed to go back there.	Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to go this way.	Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quiet!	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.	Like this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They've got something.	Keep the light up.  I can't see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut them up!	Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop!	Holy mother, what is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Argo!  Hobbes!	Get back!  Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh... my... God!	Quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, what is this?	Another storage room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no.  I smell it.	Keep the animal quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mbwun.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of egg is it?	It's reptilian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!	What kind of hormones?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Dr. Frock safe!	Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not what I saw.	All right.  If you're positive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pendergast?  Are you all right?	No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was D'Agosta.	The planetarium!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hide quickly!	What are you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it doing?	It's scared of me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to try and draw it off!	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help someone!	Oh God!  Help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You smell that?	It's coming.  Run.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just like John.  He won't listen.	I have to shoot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Close up?	No, hold back...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.	He gave it back to his father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.	What have we missed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not watching the sea.	Why would we--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cue music...	What music?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He doesn't care.	Do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	I'm the creator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can they have a child?	It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Why not?	You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.	Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You take Japanese.	Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?	That's right.  Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--	--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Actually, I'm free Sunday.	Now.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.	If we don't go now, it won't happen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what do you want to do?	I think I've studied enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?	I...I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.	Yeah?  Outta what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marlon--	--Truman, what are you doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	It's a surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what do you think?	They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was hoping we could have a special evening.	I won't be late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing down here?	Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I know.	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you want?	I made macaroni.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Arrah!	Oh, my God!
What do I do?	I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?	Put some butter on it--or ice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go now.	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's hard to go places, isn't it?	There's been an accident, Truman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Truman, I took the ""hypocrite"" oath!"	I bet you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Truman, what about that sign?	I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you, Mother?	Well, I made it through another night.
How's your hip?	Oh, just so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you tomorrow, Truman.	You can count on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you live around here?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you better tell us.	We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.	You're not FBI agents.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poopy day?	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need your clothes, Byers.	Me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got something to show me.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This man's still alive.	Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	We have a situation. The members are assembling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who called this meeting?	Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?	You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.	Looking for him for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You looking for him for some other reason?	Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?	No. Don't bother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that?	Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You follow me out here for a reason?	Yeah, I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.	I know the name. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those people were already dead.	Before the bomb went off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you're full of shit.	Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can I reach you?	You can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mulder...?	What happened to playing a hunch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	It's locked?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Had you.	No you didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?	Something sweet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scully...	Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?	I'm in the vending room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scully, get somebody to open this door.	Nice try, Mulder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.	Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...thirteen fifty six...	Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something's not right...	-- Mulder! Get in the car!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wake you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you drunk, Mulder?	I was until about an hour ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go home, Mulder. It's late.	Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?	Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's like jelly.	There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This looks like new grass to you?	It looks pretty green for this climate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are my choices?	About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?	We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think they went left?	I don't know why I think they went right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?	This is great. This is fitting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think it is?	I have no idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.	For the purpose of what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hear that?	I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scully....?	Yeah...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd they go?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What's wrong?	Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What happened?	I think... something stung me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to keep moving.	Where are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't go any farther.	Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agent Mulder --	Where's Scully?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we being watched?	I'm not taking any chances.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I've got to find Scully.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Mulder.	What happened to Kurtzweil?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Scully?	I have answers for you.
Is she alive?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me out. Stop the car.	Driver.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sing a song of sixpence...	A pocketful of rye...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hates me.	Lucien Baines?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She adores you.	She thinks I can bring Edward back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miriam...	Shush.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't bring it home in this.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sing a song of sixpence.	A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Nothing.	Why did we stop?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it cold in here?	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...a pocketful of rye.	Four and twenty blackbirds...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn him.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...	I don't need them anymore...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.	Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.	Give a kiss to Edward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This man is deeply disturbed, he...	You don't know the procedure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agent Novak?	Peter, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
With Stargher I saw things...	What did you see?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why'd you bring him here?	You're the shrink, you tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.	I did, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	What difference does it make...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait...	"Like hell ""wait."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...	Little boy?!  That's him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell are we?	Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
<EOC>	<EOC>
COME ON!	I can't leave him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That went well.	Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure about this?	Absolutely.  Abigail...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard Julia and John got married.	Yep.  Eloped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're hungry.	I got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	No problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You liked him?	He's beautiful...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?	's broken.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agent Cole.	I need you to find something in the basement...
Already there.	That hoist, with the winch...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?	They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Intravenous administration complete.	Initiating connection.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She changed the codes.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Instead of going into his mind...	She's bringing Stargher into hers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When did he lapse into the coma?	Sometime yesterday morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Catherine!	I'll get her...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Into Stargher.  Inside...	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nervous?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the patient.	Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?	Completely unaware.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone looking after her little girl?	Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So?	Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need it.	Now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is she?	Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right here.	Next time, tell me, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.	Considering where I've been...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Den leuten.	Ja, ja, ja.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Warscheinlich ist der murder.	They think you did it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Sit down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were awfully good.	Do you understand German?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	He has a little dog.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. They didn't answer.	I was told there were only two men there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything really wrong with your papers?	They're forged.
Why?	The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drink?	Whiskey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you looking for now?	Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.	Need we go through it all again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?	Just another part I've got to learn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I hear you?	In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?	Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I...	Well you read this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gestern bein heurigen...	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me about him.	Tell you what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...to steal my girl.	Where is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, that was many years ago.	Tell me more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...and buried him.	Anna.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Harry's place, isn't it?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go away.	What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.	Wait here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wer ist da?	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going back home.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to your hand?	A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?	Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...you know.	He told you, didn't he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...again.	There isn't enough for two laughs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going, too?	Oh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...is there?	How did you know I would be here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Headquarters.	Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harry.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?	Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, it will be cold on that train.	I shall be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?	He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?	I saw him today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did he say anything about me - tell me?	Oh, the usual things...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's his headache.	His.
Oh, well.	Why are you lying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nichts danke. Kein.	Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...parents.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know this man?	I have never seen him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joseph Harbin...	No.
He works in a military hospital.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.	What did you say? I'm sorry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.	I don't want it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.	I don't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	I was a friend of Harry Lime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	This is forgery. It is very clever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Austrian Police Headquarters.	Can I have that woman's passport?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you tell me whose...	Fellow called Lime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is Calloway.	Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?	Yes.
Been here long?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See much of him before that?	Once in a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...to him.	What are you trying to say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.	Ever seen one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.	It wasn't petrol.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen, Callaghan.	Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the devil?	Getting around, Martins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?	Calloway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Schmidt.	You're not locking her up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A parrot bit me.	Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	In Vienna...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.	Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Next, Paine.	I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So would I.	Bring him in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...a week ago.	It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...be responsible for you in the streets.	I'm not asking you to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...in the morning.	Thank you. Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It wouldn't work.	We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A girl of spirit.	She's right. It's none of my business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't I?	You all did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time is it?	Two thirty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?	I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute - let me out.	Well, there's not much time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be sensible, Martins.	I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"...of Santa Fe."""	I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I go over there, sir?	No, no. Leave them for a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.	Oh, Mr. Martins...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...his number.	I'll look it up for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come upstairs a moment.	I know a very good dentist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.	Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zane Grey.	Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very popular, sir.	Very popular. Are you staying long?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...leaving tomorrow, sir.	Excuse me, have you got tooth...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...	It's good to see you, Holly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hmm.	She's been arrested.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?	I told the police.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.	You wouldn't do anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You told them, didn't you?	Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...this way.	What do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.	Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really liked it?	At the end of every chapter --
<EOC>	<EOC>
...were of you.	What did he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...you know and all that.	But he said he died instantaneously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...you.	Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...the best way one can, you know.	What's the name of this girl?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet.	But you will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.	The Roumanian?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.	How do you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you mad?	All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Winkel?	Vinkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Martins.	Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.	I have guests waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Find out?	Hear the details.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could he have been at all conscious?	I understand...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Speak English?	English?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Already gone.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffin?	Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baron Kurtz.	Must be some mistake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me!	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you know Mr. Lime well?	Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...	Yes, yes, I remember you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Popescu...	und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...give evidence.	Who else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kurtz.	Yes.
The Roumanian?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, it is.	I am not a bad man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harry...	Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's all you meant?	What else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?	He didn't want to get involved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Joseph Harbin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Third Man.	A novel, Mr. Martins?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Martins...	Not when I get interested.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...this time.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I make it all fact?	Why no, Mr. Martins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Mr. Martins?	Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Passport, please.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the purpose of your visit here?	A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Where are you staying?	With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lime.  Harry Lime.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll share something with you.	I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bonjour.	Good morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.	She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.	We moved rooms because of him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.	Nice work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.	Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know - I'm American.	So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.	So how many miles do you think it is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone ok?	We're ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Richard - I saw a fin!	What!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She is gone!	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Moliere?	Fuck off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One kilometer	Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bonsoir.	Eh - bonsoir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you sleep well?	Not too bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi there. Here, take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So from there to there?	We swim.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you told someone?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think so too.	One night I will get the perfect photograph.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We lost our key.	Where did you lose it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fucking Danny, man...	He's an asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think you're doing?	Who the fuck are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.	Then I won't bring you....
<EOC>	<EOC>
You coming?	We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do we have to listen to this shit?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you care?	I don't, but...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, but not on the letters.	Why the fuck not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why no silencer?	You want it to be an event.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?	That's stupid. Why would they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.	Yes, I am. Basically I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's Linda?	Why won't you talk to me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When can I see you?	You can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your father??	He's at a home out here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm coming to your room tonight.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get this?	I stole it. From a synagogue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nazis talk about it all the time.	Do they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a much easier game.	Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought there were people here....	I'll go look....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's Eichmann?	Who's Eichmann?!!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.	What'd you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you taking that?	I'm stealing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
An investment banking house.	He's Jewish? Manzetti?
<EOC>	<EOC>
More cultural than political.	Obviously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....	That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I always won.	The arguments, anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you come tonight? To see me?	To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.	That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you feel you're making progress here?	You mean Ilio Manzetti?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How have things been going?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who knows what that is?	A Jewish prayer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which was his room?	Number ten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one were you aiming at?	The mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up. Fuck you....	What...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Open it up.	Here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Drake, did he ever show up?	No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, what is this shit?	Keep driving. Don't slow down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When do you want it to go off?	Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You remember Miriam....	Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --	Shut up...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who'd you kill?	Four. But no one this important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you know they were Jews?	I can tell....
How?	I was a Jew in a previous life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You missed on purpose.	I didn't. I told you, I can't --
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what did you do?	What are you trying to say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Friday....	Do I give a shit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's this?	Dennis Leary.
Leary?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howard Stern.	Obviously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam Sandler.	Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.	He was funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.	Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think I...	Danny, please, we don't want to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going to keep it?	Yes.
Does he know?	No.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.	I can't... I just don't know how to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're leaving?	Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you tell him?	Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tell you she's mine!	Hello!
You know each other?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You forgot the Hula!	Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And just where are you from?	Italy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, good night, then...	You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jacques!  Johana!	Enzo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roberto?  How long?	Six seconds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enzo, wake up!	Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get that?	"""That""!  This is not a ""that""..."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he here?	He's training.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jacques, my friend, how are you?	Enzo...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no!	Not at all!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madame...	... And his friend, Johana...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	... For the mermaids.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here...  Here...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You still collect them?	Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?	No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I come in?	No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody can have a bad day!	I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!	Thank you, thank you very much!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were right.	... I was right about what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Push me back in the water...	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you have a heater?	Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I recognize you.	We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?	No... in the hut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, have a seat.	Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.	... Okay.  I'll try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you'd be at the dinner.	It's too loud for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look adorable.	Thank you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.	Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?	Only to help the medics, I assure you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... No?	No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can you tell it's a female?	... The way she moves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?	Uh... Yes, of course!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jacques, you set a world record.	I did?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	It's me... Johana.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you?	I got fired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	It's me again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm being a pain, huh?	... Not at all.
You sure?	Absolutely positive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	... Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jacques...?	You go back, I'll walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to tell me what happened?	I saw how it has to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.	That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise me one thing.	Anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.	... Are you sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.	Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you ask me?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?	Louis, we were French!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!	... Sally?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.	Again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	What?
How was your trip?	Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you said he was Peruvian?	Haven't you been listening?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who... Who is that?	Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.	But... how is he going to breathe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?	Coffee might be nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait!  Professor...?	... Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go see how he's doing.	Let him sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.	What's up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like I got a plane to catch.	Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So why the long face?	It's Esther. Santa's got her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. Do you have a name?	It's Esther.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That got annoying fairly quickly.	Yeah, no kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to get a drink?	Sure. Why not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that!?	I said, do you come here often!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?	I said, yeah, about once a week!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry. I'm better with men.	Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mordechai?	Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.	Oh. Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Esther!	Mordechai!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Esther!	Mordechai!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two know each other?	We go to the same temple.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hammer, you alright?	Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.	The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?	Worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wasn't too over the top?	No, it was the perfect level.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on? Why'd he stop?	Maybe he ran out of ammo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What day is it?	It's Friday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?	That depends. How much money has he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.	Good looking?
Mmmyes.	Nice fellow?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he in love with you?	I don't know -
<EOC>	<EOC>
"This is for ""mama and the kids."""	What about me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's that man?	Up at the museum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure!	No. I'm serious about this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.	Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's left of him.	Where? Where did you find it?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't look at it!	Let me see it 
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you tomorrow -	Tomorrow -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I'd best be off.	I want to ask you something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know Charlie How-Come?	We're old friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come to look around?	More or less.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -"	Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
<EOC>	<EOC>
State hunters?	Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. The lipstick.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Now look what you've done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"	As long as my feet held out."	And not a sign of the leopard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What else do you care about, Kicks?	You. Us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.	You're positive of that, aren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kiki?	It's all right. I'm not hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.	Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeanne, stop it!	How dare you stop me doing God's will!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
The king said you're his finest archer...?	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go.	Jeanne, no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you at least let me stay with you?	It would not be the same without you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must sound the retreat!	Not yet!
<EOC>	<EOC>
W-w-what are you doing?!	Performing a miracle.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
This is no good!	No good?  This is a disaster!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clear?	Perfectly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?	No... not like this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah...	Here -- take this instead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?	God knows, but it was a bad idea!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Prepare these as battering-rams!	What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?	It's like this... I...we...all of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone you know?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to get a doctor.	You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.	Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.	Wladek, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.	Wladek, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wladyslaw Szpilman.	Dorota.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
And how's Yurek?	Dead.

Will I still be able to play?	Let's find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not going to be very comfortable.	I'll be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get your things together, you have to leave!	What's happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen this?	What, I'm working, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Halina?	What?
Funny time to say this.	What?
wish I knew you better.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They bombed us, we're off the air.	Warsaw's not the only radio station.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mama, that was a great dinner.	It certainly was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter? Are you sick?	Hungry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very appropriate.	Yes, that's why I brought it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have you been here?	Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.	It's a little cut, nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.	Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.	Out of Warsaw. Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing?	I was... I was trying to open this tin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your work?	I am... I was a pianist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you hiding?	In the attic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	We're getting out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are the Russians here?	Not yet.

Watch your feet!	Watch your feet!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Careful! Watch his hand.	Watch his hand
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.	Yes, like a cave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.	There is something to be said for silence
<EOC>	<EOC>
My REAL father was a famous German composer	Ohh the tag is broken.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that is a strong opinion.	Yes, it's unholy.

She looks tired.	She's stunted, that's one thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he say?	Someone died here. It's tapu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, why not.	Ada says you're doing well with the piano?

He's waitin' for you in the card room.	Let him wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just worry about your end, kid.	If we ever get to it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd ya do?	Well we got some workin' money anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything go all right?	Yeh, it was easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think he'll show?	Did he say he wouldn't?
No.	He'll show.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?	I thought I'd lost him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.	Just a little nervous, that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the problem?	He wants to put a half million on Syphon.

You stayin' in or not?	I'm in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I didn't get the bet down in time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.	Come on, gimme a break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about this Rosebreen?	Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cheer up, darling.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?	It's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any luck?	He's just around the corner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you?	Another young man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well!	That is, if it's all right with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I look around?	Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?	You're high enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.  It's horrible.	Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!	Now do you believe me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother!	And I'll give then proof!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.	Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is your father still in there?	He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?	He wouldn't say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't do it -- Nick!	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another Martini --	Hello, there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, we know each other.	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Aren't you Nick Charles?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on in.	I've got to see you alone!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get this gun?	I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.	That's the truth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dead?	He's been dead for three months.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's been the same one for three months.	Forgive me.  How are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll still be your son-in-law!	You see how much we have to say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your brother?	He's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never saw him before.	What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.	What's that to you?
Nothing.	What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.	I'm asking you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not without a warrant.	So you say -  Go on, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you got a pistol permit?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This gun yours?	No.
Who's is it?	I'll have to try to remember.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just rolled them up and threw them in.	Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing here?	I'll take care of him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean that body-----?	--was Wynant's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.	Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did!	That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's ridiculous.	Let him have his say out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning --	Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we may as well sit down.	I guess all the suspects are here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!	Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're just having a little drink.	So I see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.	That's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got word from Wynant this morning...	So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get my money?	I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I'm not telling anyone.	But suppose some business comes up...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you?	I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have no right to answer that.	What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Nick... Nick!	Hello, Mimi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tell you -- he didn't do it.	They'll want more than your word for that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	This is your party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You might have mentioned me first.	He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What hit me?	That last Martini.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's that?	Santa Claus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't that my drink?	What are you drinking?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She didn't tell me a thing.	Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That poor girl is in a tough spot.	There's nothing I can do to help her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never saw that before.	No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?	You did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello... send him up.	Who's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you hot in that?	I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?	Yes.
Did I give it to you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.	Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!	It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Sit down!	You talk as if I were Asta.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long has he been dead?	Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.	Smart gal.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?	No.  Nobody but you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.	Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?	No... no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick Charles here?	Yes.  Nick!
You his wife?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Home!
Home?	I'm fired.
Who fired you?	You did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?	Y-yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paper.	It's a fortune box.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.	No, please, not again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we going to do!?	We're going to keep driving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They stopped.	Wha...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing.	Low on gas.  Got to refill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got rope?	For climbing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.  Let's get out of here.	The soldiers are going to kill those people!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The US Army:  Always an adventure.	Let me see the map.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And they can't fly around out there forever.	So we wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Missile!	Move!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Epps!	I heard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it!	I told you; don't push me around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're out of your mind.	He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.	We're at war.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just keep quiet.	I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?	If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.	There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.	There might be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?  What!?	I did it!  I got the box open.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now this is war.	Roger that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take the binoculars.	Wh-what do you think--
<EOC>	<EOC>
She okay?	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'd make their heads explode.	Millionaires, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do with the Humvee?	We leave it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SAY IT!	I got that...sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?	Mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Mine.  Land mine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a way.	Epps...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.	Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This.  Whatever it is.	It's the treasure, that's what it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't hear any--	Shut up and listen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't!	It's a fire fight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.	What are they doing here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it?  Where'd it go?	Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?	Just stay down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A whole lot of nothing.	So where do we start?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.	It's giving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just a mongoose.	Is it dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry about that, Epps.	Is it all right if I stand up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	Damn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wonder how the war's going?	It's got to be going better than this..
<EOC>	<EOC>
I pick that way.	Okay.  Then we go this way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	Well, we should identify ourselves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't you--	I don't have a weapon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way do we go!?	We go this way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.	He'll slow down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not slowing.	He's going to slow down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?	Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?	The photos.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spanish wasn't hard enough?	I thought it would be good to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this?	Now you need me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you're the guy who's going to open it.	I could.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.	It's a container.  Break the seal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We...we could go home with something else.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.	Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Epps, is that a sand dune.	Oh, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If there's gold.  If!	You know what I'm doing with my half?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Iraqis.	Oh, God!
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.	Oh, Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought we were dead.	Yeah, well, we're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there anything you do know?	I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So?	We have to do something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think we can make it?	We make it, or we go back empty handed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Lines up with the map and the photos.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's got a bottom.	Guess we know what the next stop is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You down?	Yeah, we're down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing!?	I think we found something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we should give him some water.	All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.	I'm not wasting my water on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?	Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drug evasion with....	triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions	Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
<EOC>	<EOC>
HUMMMM.....	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry up.	4732...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?	Vocasity
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not hungry.	Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?  Why did you change it?	You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.	Eat your dinner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't done anything.	Don't be so sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never been under the table before.	Look,dirt!
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.	Looks like dirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, food!	That's not food.  Can't be food.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?	No....I though  I'm afraid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.	Don't let them separate us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	AH UGH.
<EOC>	<EOC>
THX!	No!...No!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on....what are you doing?	We're leaving.
What?	We're leaving.
Who?  Who's leaving?	THX and me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How far did you go?  Was it cold?	You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got it!  Astounding!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm leaving.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm leaving.	When?.....How?
Right now.	But you can't...you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?	No, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way?	That way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know?	Look more closely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've lost SEN!	What?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.	Too late....stay close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.	All the insides are gone!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I knew him.	Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not it.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not there	No......  She's dead THX........
You don't know that!	All right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remember this...?	Where's LUH?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...no you're wrong.	I'm only trying to help you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	What do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just look at all those people.	I thought of something.....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, that's the guy-	We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffee, Mike?	No thanks, Bev.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dispatch, this is Reilly.	Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.	Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.	Hang on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the heck're you?	You the Bomb Squad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get this?	Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.	"So you're the ""Device Squad""... and you defuse ""devices""?"
Treat. We treat devices.	Anything else I should know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where the van was parked.	Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...	Look, it's a longshot...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long are we going to stay?	`Til we get a better lead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long were you hooked?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's working.	Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ex-girlfriend?	Be right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck factor?	Off the scale.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Talk to me. Let's assess.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good, now the other side.	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...	Don't touch that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More metal... sharp edge...	Stay to your left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?	Easy, guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whadaya mean?	It's from an IRA.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Bev, you're the greatest...	Hey, I'm next.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What do ay say?	Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright!	We've created a monster.

Jesus...	Reilly! He's loaded!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then why tell me?	People are dying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Alex-
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	Security.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Nothing... just tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No... No more killing.	Stay here.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you calling, sis?	What? Nobody, I-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex, please-	Shut up!  Who is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drop it.	Take him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell was that?	A ticking bomb...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Prints?	Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?	Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's going on?	Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
<EOC>	<EOC>
He is!	Look, it's important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...	What kind of bomb was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're you guys doing?	Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.	Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pooch, can you move it?	I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.	Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh shit...	Fuck factor ten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah, just a nick ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike...	Don't talk.

It don't work-	Ain't that a shit--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reilly, Vice. I-	Quiet!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Make an appointment.	It's about this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
P.E.T.N ...	What?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to be here.	That feeling won't last long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-	I'll do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir...	I thought I told you--
<EOC>	<EOC>
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.	Yes, M'sieu Laval?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?	erect in sweater, arms folded.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
With the compliments of Colet and Company!	He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?	The pleasure is mine, madame.

Do you know my first name?	No. What is it? Tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crimson!	Correct!  Good night.
Good night.	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, let me have a little fun.	Please!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thirty-three--	No--thirty-five!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.	I don't believe it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?	Giron...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.	No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
No, m'sieu!	Yes, madame!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two lumps, madame?	Please!  Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, madame?	How much is your salary?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your bag?	Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?	Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
No--I'm sorry.	But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--	Well, where is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much time?	An hour, two at most.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.	Thank you, Rose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck to you, Rose.	And to you, Mr. Andrews.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's the best? Say it.	You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
<EOC>	<EOC>
None of the stewards have seen her.	This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I make my own luck.	So do I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I don't like that, Rose.	She knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God... Cal. Is it a --	Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this in any way unclear?	What do I tell your mother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're precious to me, Rose.	Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This should be amusing.	Can I bum a cigarette?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a good liar.	Almost as good as you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!	Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.	Bollocks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cor... look at that, would ya.	They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.	Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why have we stopped?	We've struck ice.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?	Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How cold?	Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Jack Dawson.	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
HELP! HELP!!	I've got you. I won't let go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello again.	Could I speak to you in private?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, you got a name by the way?	Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Just some sketches.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And...?	You wouldn'ta jumped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I cut in, miss?	You're still my best girl, Cora.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know the steps.	Just move with me. Don't think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fabrizio said you might be up --	Sssshh. Come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.	Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where to, Miss?	To the stars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you nervous?	Au contraire, mon cher.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're trembling.	It's okay. I'm alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.	This is crazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks okay. I don't see anything.	Could it have damaged the ship?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's bad.	We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Now it's worse.	Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!	He couldn't have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.	I know, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to go for help.	I'll be right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will this work?	We'll find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not going without you.	Get in the boat, Rose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You jump, I jump, right?	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.	It's so cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's been 84 years...	Just tell us what you can --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't come any closer.	You had it the entire time?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --	Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.	Charmed, I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rose, get in the boat!	Goodbye, mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hope we're not intruding.	This is Miss Marsh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well--shall we go into dinner?	I'll join you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?	Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good afternoon--	Glad to see you again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope so.	That's a date.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.	We'll save you a place at our table.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't she lovely?	Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you pardon me?	<U>Gladly</U>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you find it?	No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
No-o!	Where's Lother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get it?	Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?	Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?	Guess again, copper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.	I'll bet a couple of hundred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aces full.	And me coming in with two pair--
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a little game later?	Fine--I'll be glad to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could I see you a minute?	Sure!  Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm so sorry!	Want to take it back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is Mr.--er--	Brett is the name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.	You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't she attractive?	Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.	You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?	Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.	But I'll have cocktails with you.
When?	At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.	Okay.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.	Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.	I'll be there--Good-by.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Mrs. Brett!	Good night, idiot!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could see you were pining away--	Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!	I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.	Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.	I'll be waiting on deck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I'll be--!!!	What's the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nix, the law!	Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--	Shortie, look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--	--there's thousands of 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?	No, sir?
My change.	Change?
<EOC>	<EOC>
About sixteen hundred.	Partners, ain't we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You keep it--	<U>Me</U>!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say--wait a minute!	See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come in!	Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's your deal.	It's a pleasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your mother feeling?	Much better--thank you--
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were a sucker--	Think again--
<EOC>	<EOC>
That goes two ways.	Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to the show--	I'll go with you--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Care to join us?	No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.	Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, young fellow!	Coming to the pool for a swim?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's your fifty.	Thanks. That makes us square.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's too bad.	I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's all right. I'll attend to this.	Wait a minute--let's match for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you are, sir.	What'll I say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you live?	In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?	Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--	No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?	Knots!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's me!	Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Yes--Me--in person!	So what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
McKinney's the name.	Miss Marsh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't--	He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--	Is this your gun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Very serious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why--don't you like him?	Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?	Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's him! That's the sucker!!	Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are, sir.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!	What's the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothin'.	Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.	Hey--you! Where you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God...	Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What d'you think of the singer?	Nice voice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He said to turn loose of him.	Well I'm not so go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get that horse?	Beauty, ain't he?
I asked where you got him.	Where do you think?  I stole him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up, Ike.	And you must be Doc Holliday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.	Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm retired.	Good.  That's real good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...	No...

<EOC>	<EOC>
Satisfied?	I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's drunk.	In vino veritas.

Florentino!  He's getting away!	Drop his horse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you do that for?	So he can tell the story.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.	Sir Elliot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...And what's that, my dear?	Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure they will.	Good-bye, Mister Bond.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.	What about the gold?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes -	Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paris?!? What are you doing here?	Is that any way to say hello?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you feel better now?	Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It must do something.	Well... If you insist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -	Not from forty feet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...	Something with an engine? Not oars?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Natalya?	Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.	I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got you covered.	That's reassuring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Does this do anything?	Depends what number you write.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Married?	Happily.
... Kids?	Three. You? Married?
No.	I didn't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I have to do everything around here?	I hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope you'll be gentle.	Think about mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what do you call this?	- The family jewels?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't we just take these -	No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait here.	No. I'm going with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... How did you get into marine salvage?	My father left me the business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not a lot of difference.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell does that do?	Cleans dirt. Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Down?	Up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sometimes you just have to -	Don't say it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.	If not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sleep well?	Next time, I do the driving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?	I didn't say when I want to die -

Damn. It's doing it again.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How is it now?	Seems to be back to normal, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is HE doing here?	I see you two have met.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -	- I told you! He was there! -
<EOC>	<EOC>
He brought that up from the wreck.	...I see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!	Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How sweet.	My timing always was lousy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.	Approaching the first gate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!	You have to leave -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take the men. I can finish alone.	You come with me -  You stay here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is the helicopter ready?	Fueled and waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is going on?	It's Bond!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.	Thank you sir! Thank you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about ID's?	One to seven: Deal the face cards.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no.	Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.	Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is that?!? What's in the box??	I don't know. He's not in the database -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will it go off?	Maybe. Maybe not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.	Will the cruise set it off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I pay my own way.	Since when?

Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?	Yes.

Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!	Not today!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!	We're not aiming for the truck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!	Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi!	Everyone, it's Woody!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, watch it!	Sorry there, old Spudhead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's string him up by his pull- string!	I got dibs on his hat!
<EOC>	<EOC>
B-3.	Miss.  G-6.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!	Heh-heh.
Are you peeking?	Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son of a building block, it's Woody!	He's in the psycho's bedroom!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, that is disgusting.	Murderer!
<EOC>	<EOC>

I don't know!	Oh no, Hannah!
What?	Look!  Janie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!!	She's sick!
No she's NOT --	I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
<EOC>	<EOC>
MOM!!  MOM!!	She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.	Have you been replaced?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That ain't no happy child.	He tortures toys -- just for fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A lunchbox?!	A lunchbox...?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...	Alright!  That's it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it this time?	I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
<EOC>	<EOC>
ROOAAAARR!!!	Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.	I was close to being scared that time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!	Hey look!  It's Buzz!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're getting bigger.	Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the heck is up there?	Woody?  Who's up there with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Sid!	I thought he was at summer camp!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?	Oh, I don't like confrontations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!	There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got it, Woody!	He got it, Woody!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?	Sir!  No Sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, we're on the last present now...	Last present!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.	Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...	Uh-oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!	Sid!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reach for the sky!!	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...	It's busted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
W-w-w-we?	That's right.  Your toys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Slinky?	Right here, Woody!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm red this time.	No, Slink --
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.	Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Bad news?!	Sh-h-h-h-h!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Woody?!	We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!	I knew you'd come back, Woody!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Woody!  Speed up!	Speed up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't hold on much longer!	Slink!  Hang on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll put your clothes here.	There's no mirror.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can manage.	Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!	I did like the music.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He made that. In his off hours.	It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to go home.	Home is where the heart is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not accustomed to being ignored.	She'll have to learn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?	Get away from me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's there?	Let me in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?	I finished it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll murder you when he finds out.	He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.	Can you move over a wee bit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it!	I've got a present for you...
Finn ...	In my pocket.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.	H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.	It was only a mouthful!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long has -	All the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '	Storms?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Melanie.	You're late for breakfast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you do this?	Victoria -
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're well built; how old are you?	Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.	It's all right, Finn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Helena, I'm so sorry --	Arnie, thank God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Helena --	I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should we bring the police into this?	No, not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My Leica's gone.	So's the video camera.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you meet the President?	Honey, your father knows the President.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you tell Dad?	Not yet.
Are you going to?	I don't know.
Is this bad for him?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
What's up?	Just watching you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if every country legalized at the same time?	Somehow, I don't see that happening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, young lady, that's it.	Like I give a fuck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Just watch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Inhale the smoke and hold it.	What is this, like freebase?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a big word for a fisherman.	Who do you work for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll put this in the back.	No --
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.	Not Tiger Woods.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David --	We're playing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You first.	I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have deal.	Fine, then we don't have a deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wasn't that General Salazar?	Yeah.
What's he doing up here?	I don't know.  Something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madrigal's alive.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somewhere safe.	Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should feel good about this.	I feel like a traitor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Javier Rodriguez.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One question.  How did you find about this?	An informant.
What is the name of your informant?	It was an anonymous tip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does this offer include my partner?	Only if he can be trusted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.	Everybody has a weakness.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are these guys?	Agents who died in the field.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you tell him?	No. On you go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.	You've stabbed me, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twenty thousand.	But it's not worth more than fifteen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For fuck's sake.	Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.	Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I've no fucking cigarettes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.	Can you not go yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.	I'd fucking kill you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.	Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Diane.	Ssshh!
Sorry.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calm down. You're not going to jail.	Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?	Certainly not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what's he like?	Well, he's young and he's healthy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tommy, let's put the tape on.	Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.	Fuck, OK.

Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.	Sorry about last night -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you getting out much?	No.
Following the game at all?	No.

What's on the menu this evening?	Your favourite dish.
Excellent.	Your usual table, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.	Are you serious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We go for a walk.	What?
A walk.	But where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He has his doubts...	You doubt me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?	He doubts me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I couldn't help but notice you pain.	My pain?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.	Rescued at last.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.	Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Following new course. Warp seven.	Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In firing position. Torpedo armed.	But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shuttle en route.	Position, Bird of Prey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?	I don't have a clue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we have it quiet?	Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?	Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your pain runs deep.	What do you know of my pain?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.	If we could send a distress signal...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.	Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.	Put it on the screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.	Go, Sulu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Pack Up Your Troubles."""	Are we leaving, Captain?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain?	Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Jim.	Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.	Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.	Goodnight, Bones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, Spock.	Goodnight, Doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could use a shower.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock.	Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.	Yes, Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must allow us to act.	Let me do something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it possible?	Is what possible?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"New word. ""b"".. ""a""... um..."	"""c.""... ""k."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
I believe I have found a faster way.	Hmmm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It would appear we are too heavy.	It must be all those marsh melons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock.	The emergency channel, open.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...mark two.	Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock... don't.	It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this?	I believe we are witnessing my birth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock?	Welcome aboard, Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock, I thought I was going to die.	Not possible. You were never alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must change our course at once.	I'll take you to the bridge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No... I didn't.	Now learn something about yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About the ship...	The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?	No conditions.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?	Because you, too, must know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have I done?	Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sybok, you must surrender.	No. You must kill me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Each man's pain is unique.	I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.	Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey... you guys OK?	How about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A User -- in our world?	Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...

There's another beam!	It's too far!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flynn, we've got to help him!	Let's get some power here.
<EOC>	<EOC>

But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.	You're still a little... disoriented.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're very close!  Because of you!	This is it, James...what you've been working for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's him.	What are you going to do with us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's important to observe everything.	I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.	Perhaps it was a wrong number...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just a shot to calm you.	No more drugs.  Please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're keeping an eye on me.	Who's keeping an eye on you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!	I did him a favor.  Now come on.

You smell so good.	You have to give yourself up, you know.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to rob him?	I...I...We need cash, James.

<EOC>	<EOC>
But you know what's real now?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?	I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.

Jake, what is that?	What does it look like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Accident.	You should be more careful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice place you got here.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.  All done.  Lift me down.	What?

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.	How do you know if you've never tried?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what can I do for you?	I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?	About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?	About what you said this morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to stay.	I said come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to your hand?	Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
Got any requests?	That country shit all sounds the same to me.

Talk?  About what?	About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?	About what you said this morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much could you get?	Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.	That's a bit much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Next time you'll do just fine.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I came for Grace.	You came to take my wife from me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You Harlin?	Nope.  Darrell.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.	Don't look like nothing.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.	Is it pretty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Grace ... Grace?	After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The money's right here! Get the key!	No! You get it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I thought you'd left me back there.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	<u>I don't know why</u>!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.	You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time to go for a walk, Jake.	My mother died in this canyon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hope is a four-letter word.	But we all need that too. Hold him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why's that?	'Cause I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Jake</u>...	He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where ya goin'?	Harlin's.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that on the phone?	Wrong number.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	You didn't hear something?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.	There's someone in the house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.	Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me, Grace, help...	Like you helped her, Jake?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to stay.	I said come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that the entire message?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wrap it up.	You've made a considerably wise decision.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Once again please?	My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?	Four.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm listening.	I'll keep it in my office room.
What about Jeb?	I have a lock on the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. It's been a while.	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Okay.	Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?	Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When was the last time I wore pink?	The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.

I assumed because of the train.	You assumed wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just give me a minute.	Is there a problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought he was carrying something.	But not a knife?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?	You're skill.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened, Joey...?	I can't talk now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you holding up?	I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?	The broad has disappeared...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...yeah...good...	...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing here?	We got to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing in New York...?	Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.  How are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to buy you a drink.	Thanks, Franky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well, well.  Huh?	Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.	That's for sure, Frank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?	I married into it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not what you think. We're very happily married.	Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.	From whom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Did she hurt herself?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!	Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just let me talk to you.	What about?
You.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.	You won't have to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen, what is this? What do you want?	I want to know who you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.	Honest?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.	But Scottie, you don't have to!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I like that one, Scottie.	No, it's not right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like it!	We'll take it! Will it fit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't even want to touch me.	Yes. Yes, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The color of your hair...	Ah, no!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where shall we go for dinner?	Wherever you'd like...
Ernie's?	You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmm.	Is that the best you can do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come here.	Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.	Too late. I've got my face on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?	No, Ernie's is fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scottie!	How does it work?
Can't you see?	Oh, yeah. There.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going awfully far.	I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	To complete my cure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.	No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.	You can't. You're afraid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I made it.	What are you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	I loved you, Madeleine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Love me... keep me safe...	Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why am I here? What happened?	You...  ...fell into the Bay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When you...  There were pins in my hair...	Oh! Yes! Here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
One shouldn't live alone.	Some people prefer it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- talking to you...	I enjoyed talking to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like some coffee?	No! No, thank you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope we will, too.	What?
Meet again, sometime.	We have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-bye.	Good-bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Shopping?
No.	Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.	Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old?	Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you hear anything?	Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.	No birds live here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like a drink of water?	No, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you now?	Here with you.
Where?	The tall trees...
Have you been here before?	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you born?	Long ago...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I can't tell you!	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take me away from here?	Home?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't leave me... stay with me...	All the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, don't go away!	Only this far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My love... because I love you.	I love you too... too late... too late...
No... we're together...	Too late... there's something I must do...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me go into the church alone.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her car is gone.	What car?
<EOC>	<EOC>
From that music.	Oh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Step number two.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Johnny!	Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
<EOC>	<EOC>
The poor thing....	And she died...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is she pretty?	Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.	Mmm, yeah, I guess...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Midge!	Bye-bye!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm. Better.	Did you need it?
Yeah.	Oh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you been doing?	Wandering.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.	But you said grey, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She'll be out in a moment.	Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes! That's it!	I thought so!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The stripper's here.	Excellent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's fucking hot!	I need a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	Don't touch her. Call 911.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How ya doing?	What?
What's that?	What did you say?
I said how's it going?	I didn't hear you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're an asshole Adam.	You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?	Multiple reasons.
Name one.	I don't have to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.	She's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.	Playing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The floor was wet. She slipped!	Why was the floor wet?
I don't know why the floor was wet!	Why?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	It's sacrilegious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.	They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About anybody but yourself. You never have.	And you're a little fucking reject.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't even start.	You want to hear me out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's got no fucking pulse.	You don't know what you're doing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to call the ambulance.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure this was an accident?	You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bury her out in the desert.	Sure, why not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her fucking head was caved in.	So I didn't fucking do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sun rises at 5:52.	I'm not wrecking the transmission!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait. Wait a minute.	What?
We can't do this.	We've already done this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to get going.	I am not flexible on this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you Boyd!	Any time fat boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is your problem?	I can't do this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?	They're on me. They're smoking me out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't snap at them!	They're driving me nuts!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.	What?
They're screaming for Starbursts.	Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the candy?	There is no candy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll be ready Adam.	I know you'll be.  Three hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's one idea.	No...we want padded chairs...okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.	What happened? Oh my God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way.	It has to be done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My god.	There's more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. When is the wedding.	Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?	Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I'm with Tina. Is she there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not here.	Where is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. Hi.	So who's the lucky guy?
Who?	The groom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is everything okay?	Great. Fine. Perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's in there!	I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No I don't.	Fish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think so Boyd.	Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But not tonight.	Not tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you look? What side of the neck?	Left side.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got her arm.	Here's his head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your fucking point?	I'm not talking to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's goosed?	What is her disposition?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He just had two.	Give me two more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said that Boyd.	Well, I didn't mean it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Jesus...call the police.	No.
She's dead. Call somebody!	Shut up.
Call 911.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.	Nobody knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody knows she's here.	Good God...Good God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.	Suck my ass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right.	Isn't it a little late?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a fucking moron.	It's my fucking opinion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The hell I did!	The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!	You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nope.	Moore?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your ideas never work out.	Oh really? Starbucks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is going to stop right now. Right now!	You will not screw this up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're goosed.	We're not goosed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it!	Goosed!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop.	Goosed!
<EOC>	<EOC>
May we have the rings please?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is ridiculous.	Government cutbacks.
Why can't we do it through the mail?	We missed the deadline.
Can't we do it on the phone?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is this Kid staring at me?	I'm not sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you love me?	Of course.
How much?	With all my heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got problems here.	Problems?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you please call the chair people?	I will.
Do you love me?	Of course.
Just call and let me know that your okay.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the word on the chairs?	I'm working on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah baby. Everything's great.	Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.	Now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.	Are they fighting?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!	Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No way.	Can we just talk this out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!	What money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's just insecurity.	I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.	What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.	About what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not breathing right.	You're not breathing right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't care for him.	He's your brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take a ride.	Go for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting married...	I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.	Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get that?	At the newsstand on 3rd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That ought to be about the end of that.	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...No.	How do you know she's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The first day.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.	A move?
Greenpeace.	Greenpeace?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Boyd?	Downstairs in the closet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.	That's what I'm thinking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good times.	Drum banging real times.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's dead.	It was an accident!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up Micheal.	I KILLED MY BROTHER!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop this, stop this.	Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the camera?	It's a present from my parents.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don Amalio!	What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...	What about them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which couch?	That one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come down here, you scamp.	Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.	Come down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean?	Nothing. I didn't say anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must think I am a monster.	No, but what a pity life is like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave us alone, Ramona.	Don't go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.	Go away! Leave me alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me pass!	You must listen to me before you go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave me now. You can go to bed.	Yes, sir. Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.	What's the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You believe me, don't you?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.	It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will the lady say?	She won't even know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it all right?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much is that?	Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?	That's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's very good.	Thank you; but it's missing something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, what have you done to him!	He was asking for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ramona! Ramona!	Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter with you?	Nothing.
Why the bad temper?	It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's mad.	No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you wake first, wake me up.	What are you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you thinking about?	That your cousin is more to your taste.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How in hell does it wind up?	I think I'd better go tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know -- they've always been there.	That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Viridiana ...	Are you Jorge?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they going to work here too?	Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And ...your friend?	She's left.
Is she coming back?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's for people!	Then let him go and he'll follow you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you today?	Things seem to be getting better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll soon find out, you liar!	Stop this!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!	Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...	Why not?
There's been an accident.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you crying?	I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.	A black bull came.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a very big one.	Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!	He couldn't get through the door, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He came in through the cupboard.	You little liar! Get out of here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on, Moncho?	This louse is looking for trouble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have decided to leave, Moncho.	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?	Mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forgive me if I have offended you.	You are forgiven. Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about you, Manuel?	I'm only good at making people laugh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She looks like a sick marrow!	Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.	Ah! Pleased to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel?	I have a headache.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?	Today, a good girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Yes, yes, I saw you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you see me?	From the terrace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.	Me? What did I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are they doing in Los Feliz?	Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	Why'd.. .you pull me out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?	If you can catch him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't anybody tell me?!	I don't set policy.  You have the key?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think you can do it?	Not from in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does he know who I am?	He hears...everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get that fucking thing away from me!	You're...such a wimp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You need a maid.	What I need is a nymphomaniac.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder how that...	Turn it down!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.	Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Should I have?	Think hard -- it'll come to you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.	All my work is my finest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You catching my drift?	I think I understand what you have in mind...
<EOC>	<EOC>
SID  NO!!!	What do you expect me to do, thank him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am beautiful, aren't I?	Of course you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't need a babysitter.	What you need is a collar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.	I'm still working on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.	How did you get your hand out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't get out of the car.	Stop me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's going on?!	This is my area of expertise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do to those people?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the problem?	I'm doing the best I can!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.	Start of what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way?	Both.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you	If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We know you didn't kill those guards.	They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.	Think he's keeping track of his creation?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See something?	I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice work.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	...I think so...You?
More or less.	Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.	Sid?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your pulse?	I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.	Duck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do now?	You won't want to watch. Turn around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's John?	Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you	Why's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you go  best seat in the house.	You are going after Mayor Bennett.

Are you lonely?	No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!

"""You know..."""	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tried to break it off!	You should have tried harder.
Claire...	Get out of my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She did it.	We don't know that for sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that for?	Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.	You don't have to do that.

<EOC>	<EOC>
But who would run the store?	Forget the store. Think big.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You do like girls, don't you?	Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?	As much as possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.	Tipping?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?	Yeah.  Everything's cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father must've been amazing.	He was in a league of his own.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	My job. Back off, Benedict.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing, Artie?	I... You know... I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look pretty.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.	And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	I'm fine.  Nice TV.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?	Suzie Toller is missing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what to say...	You could tell me where you were last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got that two o'clock in town.	Back to the land of grownups.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You saw the news today?	Lombardo's settlement?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?	I net a guy in a bar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I kind of lost it there.	You could say that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you want company...	Just check out the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.	We don't know that, Ray...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you do me one favor?	Ray, you heard him...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That bothers you?	Yeah, maybe, a little.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He did say something.	What was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want a full-scale investigation.	You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ms. Toller?	I said he did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This wasn't my idea.	I'm sorry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?	What?
A ride.  You want one?	Yeah.  But I got my bike.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you looking at?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought we were goin' to a movie.	I think we just need to get wasted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wanna live at the beach someday.	Shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there some reason why you're here?	Curiosity, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get off my property.	I'm not on your property!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that Sam Lombardo?	Hi, Mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Which one of your ""bodyguards"" is that?"	Whichever one I want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, what's the matter?	You notice my new jumper?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kelly.  What is it?	I miss Dad.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...	No you don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He... Sam Lombardo?	Yes.  God, Mom...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't forget the car wash.	I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the hose?  We can set up.	In back of the garage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?	So you got my mom's money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?	About six and a half million dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.	That's not your line.
Say you love me.	I love you.  Now give me the line.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm running away.	You think that's wise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.	I did.  At Blue Balls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Will they?
It doesn't look like it.	Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Davy.	That's right.  That was his name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But she ran away.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sam...	Put Kelly on too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	That was the same thing Ray said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But don't pull that again.	Wouldn't dream of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That should put us ahead of the criminals.	I'll work on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a lot of butler.	Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never seen a gun fire so fast!	It's a repeating steam cannon!
<EOC>	<EOC>
At least I tried something.	Hey, I tried the board.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.	I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're so precious when they're asleep.	You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Know what this is?	Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is good.	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Willard...	It's not a guy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.	Relax.  We're almost there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not again.	I adjusted it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When we find him, he is mine.	Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was in your book.	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are those just button buttons or...?	Of course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My hat is off to you, sir.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God!  He's so excessive!	Where have you been?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.	I'm sure we will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't tell us you had this on!	My Lord, he was telling the truth!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He calls it the Tarantula.	But it only has six legs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A new friend?	We'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.	Would that include me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've... done... this... before.	I've had some practice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My.  It's gotten longer.	You bring the best out in a man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your private train, sir.	Private train?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?	I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good work.  Really.	This is Colonel Richards.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.	How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Pemberton?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is something.	It's a smelting retort.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now it's a bomb.	It is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	They're coming.
When are they coming?	They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey...!	You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?	Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You left me to die, friend.	You managed alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're chasing a dream.	Just get me some horses.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, friend.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Willow Ufgood.	Yes...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They look like acorns.	Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir!  I have to talk to you.	Not today, Willow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You!  Are you the mother of that child?	No.  I mean yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't.	Let me see it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gawd...you're...beautiful...	You're not a woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.	My step-father's going to tear you apart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do what I'm told.	Too bad you're not more like your father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a fool.  Now put her back.	I'm not going to let this baby die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you say that?	Say what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because it's true.	I don't believe you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorsha.	Madmartigan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.	I have no family.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then you get us out of here.	I will!  But I need help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is that girl, anyway?	Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're a tiny version of all that?	As above, so below.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.	Good.  How long will it take?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?	Why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Somebody's coming!	Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You a woodcutter?	Farmer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smells like a battle.	Are you a warrior?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?  I hear something!	You hear trouble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?	I hate this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta promise to feed her.	I will.
Fresh goat's milk.	Absolutely!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You!!	Where the hell did you come from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Give me that baby!	These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time to change her diaper.	Time to leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because she's sick.	Because she's sick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the baby??	I thought you had her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll help you...!	I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did she ask about me?	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She said lots of thing.s	Willow!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She asked about you, Madmartigan.	Well what did she say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's in love.	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.	Want me to carry Elora?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't we keep it, Dada?	Absolutely not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dada, what's a daikini?	Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill him!	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did *you* give that acorn its power?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must learn magic.	That's all I ever wanted!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm all finished.  Now what?	Burn it to a fine ash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How am I gonna do that?	Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But what am I gonna transform??	Me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch!!	Shhhhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?	His will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tir Asleen.	There's nobody here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time is running out.	Surrender!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Patience, Willow.	Courage, Willow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.	He never misses.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not going in there.	Me neither!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get back here, Rool!	Ouch!  Let go of me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She needs to be changed.	I changed her already!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not going well.	Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Talk!  Say something!	I can't see anything--she's too bright!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?	Guess I'm not used to so much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are these orphans, anyway?	They're Amish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I came to see Rachel Lapp.	Try the house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.	It's been a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your hole is healed, then?	Pretty much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nail it!	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything is all right, John.	Pick up the hat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw him.	Who'd you see?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?	No... I saw the man who killed him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was... like him.	Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.	You don't say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sam...	...I want to say a thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't let them hurt you.	I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who else knows?	Just us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all over, Paul.	Move! Or you die right here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But not a good tired.	What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your sister said you don't have a family?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you taking us now?	Home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.	I was wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?	No, no doctor...
But why?	Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell him his tea stinks.	You tell him. When you're able.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The... bullets?	Oh. The bullets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.	But... You may not be well enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When will you be going?	Not long... A few days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you to take this... to remember by.	Where's my baggy pants?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody know about this?	I didn't even know about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hear me?	I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.	Say again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know where he is.	Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.	Probably.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You admit you're lying?	I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.	He's got my number.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you find him?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything okay?	Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that man?	His name is John Book.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is the English dead?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That has no place in this house.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Rachel...	I have to help him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She say where he is?	I don't think she knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Carter?	Tight. But I'm working on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not in this building.	All right, where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll live.	You might have killed him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get back in there.	My son is out there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Momma... are they angry with us.	No... No. It is just the English way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to stay here.	They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.	I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
From now on you'll be history	You'll be hist...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhhhh -- yes...	I don't believe you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!	Oh ....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Run, Toto, run!	Catch him, you fool!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Toto, too?	Toto, too.
Oh, now?	Whenever you wish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready now?	Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes --	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's our farm!	Oh -- yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...her face is careworn.	Yes...That's Aunt Em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...room --	Has it poppies on the wall....
<EOC>	<EOC>
...bed.	Oh, no -- no!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.	Oh, you....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh --	But you couldn't have been, could you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oil can.....Oil can....	Did you say something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you want to be oiled first?	My mouth -- my mouth!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh --	All hollow.  Oh --
<EOC>	<EOC>
We might.	Oh --
<EOC>	<EOC>
And bears!	What sort of an animal is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And him a brain.	I'm sure he could give you some courage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't that female take no for an answer?	Oh --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Why only --  Oh --	Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh! Something bit me, too!	Now come on - you're acting silly --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dorothy!	I knew you would!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!	Yes...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...yes.	Look -- it ticks!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...has been simply unbearable.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A home --	The nerve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes -- let's run!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho	Hah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's her?  Who's her?	It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a hippopotamus?	Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?	I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.	Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.	But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!	Oh, come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- Oh, come on.	Huh?  What'd he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does it work?	No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!	Did they hurtcha?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're coming back!	Ohhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!	Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...don't talk.	It's pleasant down that way, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...yes.	Ohhhh --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oil can what?	Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He said his mouth.	Here -- here --
The other side....	Yes --- there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!	Oh --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh --	Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- Oh --	Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, come on now - everybody --	Did you just hear what I just heard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No -- No -- No -- No!	Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Ah --
Dorothy next!	Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if it were a brontosaurus?	I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would...would it do any good if I roared?	Who at?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!	I -- Oh --
Here --   Come on.	What was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up!	Now...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop pushing!	Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where -- where do we go now?	This way!  Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You humbug!	Yeah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why!	Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't slept in weeks.	Why don't you try counting sheep?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not even a rhinoceros?	Imposserous!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a whatzis.	It's a whatzis?
Whozat?	Whozat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No?  Now, wait a minute.	You don't neither --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do we go now?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't get around us that easy!	Not nohow!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Gale!	Howdy, Miss Gulch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Tin Man!	Ohhhh -- it's me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, sir!	No, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right.	We do.
To Oz?	To Oz!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Animals that -- that eat straw?	Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd be gentle as a lizard --	I'd be clever as a gizzard --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then I'm sure to get a brain --	A heart --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on -- come on --	Hurry -- hurry --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Dorothy!	Dorothy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!	Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ha -- ha -- ha --	Ho -- ho --ho
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, did - did you see that?	Oh - look out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a whozis.	It's a whozis?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...to Dorothy!	Oh --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, you don't.	Oh, no!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh - upstairs, quickly!	Go on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey -- what about Dorothy?	Yes -- how about Dorothy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well --	You promised us real things -- a real...
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Ruined my exit!	Help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to Len Tashka?	Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!	Then its no longer a bomb?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there another way?	We go down to the torpedo bay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hes sealed himself in.	Hes going to insert the plutonium.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what youre doing?	Like riding a bike.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of bikes did you ride?	Just wanted to put him on edge...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weve got to get out.	We cant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love Christmas in Turkey.	So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Its just a scratch.	James.  It wouldnt really be...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then maybe Id be... open to that.	Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...	I could come for a second opinion?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Constructions not exactly my line.	Quite the opposite, in fact.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ive scheduled a medical for you.	Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.	Indeed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.	Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beautiful, isnt it?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was my father.	Im sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God...were buried alive...	Were alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I cant stay here.	Youre not going to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  It will cave in!	Its the only way out...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I cant stay.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	...you should rest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
James...	I have to go.
Then take me with you.	No. Youll be safe here.
I dont want to be safe!	I have to go to work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vodka martini.	Two. Shaken not stirred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surely you believe in living dangerously.	Not at that price. Time to surrender.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could have given you the world.	Not interested.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wheres M?	Soon shell be everywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All this, because you fell for Renard?	Five more turns and your neck will break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was this all about the oil?	It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
<EOC>	<EOC>
One... last... screw?	Oh James.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now...where were we?	A rope!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Maidens Tower.	How appropriate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! Bond!	Bond!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ill send someone out.	Could...could you come?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps this isnt the time...	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Warm.	Is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.	How would you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was a...good lover?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?	Yes.  Au revoir...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The parcels in the post.	Its heading for the oil terminal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any word from him?	Still no contact yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A whore fucking.	Who is she?  Do you know her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Jon.	Hello, Adrian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The bearer of bad news.	We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?	Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What -- am I --	Cured, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jon, where are we?	Veidt¹s complex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What??	I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His what?	His . . . whatever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?	Memory lane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.	What are you up to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This'd better not be what I think it is.	Okay!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're following us.	All right.  Mission accomplished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	The costumes.  Am I right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he doing?	I think he's going to the john.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He saved himself.  He changed the past.	Where did he go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dan, is this -- is this New York??	Those cars.  What year is this??
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Laurie?	I don't think she's coming with us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can fix it.	-- What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adrian.	Laurie!  Good to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't rub it in.  I live here.	And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --	I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the hell are you?	The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?	Looks like a diner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that all?	Just remember, I'll be watching.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...	The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.	I've seen enough. Turn it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatchu doing here?	Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd the damn truck go?!	Go to the water, it's that way!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Toadies right behind.	Let me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	A piece of shrapnel hit me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing. He had two days.	Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Peace conference...	Nice place to start, don't you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your standard dart gun.	That one I'm real familiar with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice hops.	The corner. Anarchy 99.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll leave you two alone to talk.	Yeah, thanks a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's so damn funny?	Been to any good diners lately?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?	A parachute. This does not argue well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?	He's a pretty good actor, though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me with this guy.	It's like you said, every man for himself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the guy.	This pizda? Never seen him before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had to inspect the merchandise first.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	This is a gift. From me to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with him?	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jean... can you?	I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?	I wanted to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.	Sure you are, sport.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should always work with a spotter.	He's busy right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let go.	Suit yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Logan, do you see this ring?	I've seen a lot of rings.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Grey.	Senator?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?	Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it you intend to do to me?	Let's just say, God works too slowly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where am I?	You're backstage at the encore of creation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've found her, Westchester Mall.	I'll go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I lost him.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that what you're looking for?	A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?	Enough for a test.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll find him.	ALIVE.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frederick Frankenstein?	You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?	Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?	No!
What was your grandfather's name?	Victor Frankenstein.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, sir.  It will never happen again.	Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give him an extra dollar.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What in God's name are you doing?	Baack!
What?	Baack!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?	MMMmmmm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
MMMmm!	Is it that music?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!	Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Darling!	Hello...?
Surprised?	Well... yes.
Miss me?	I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I will!  Goodbye, darling!	Goodbye, darling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, darling.	Goodbye, darling!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Darling!	Darling!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surprised?	Surprised!
Love me?	Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready, darling?	Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a strange fellow.	Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you suggesting I call him master???	No, of course not.  I just meant...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night.	That's my good boy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean... the laboratory??	Yes!... the laboratory.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.	May I have it, please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Frankenstein?	Fron kon steen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long will this whole thing take?	A week.  Ten days at most.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frederick Frankenstein?	Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?	No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?	No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?	It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.	You must be Igor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.	But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?	You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are these your bags?	Yes, just the two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.	I beg your pardon?
There wolf!  There castle!	Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Home!	Home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Down!  Get down, you beasts!	I wonder what's got into them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But what you were doing?	Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music?	What?
Did you hear that strange music??	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this place?	Must be the music room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a filthy job!	Could be worse!
How?	Could be raining!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have the name I wrote down?	Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.	Was he any good?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Throw the second switch!	This guy means business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't try to cheer me up that way.	Well, I don't like to see you mope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Original.	Give -- me -- your -- hand!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.	You can say that again.
Yes.	You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.	... I'm glad that's...
No, no!  That whole thing!	... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going?	What did you find out?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he?	How do you know it was a 'he'?
All right -- where is she?	How do you know it was a 'she'?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!	Can you play it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks...for all your help.	That's what we're paid for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a failure.	Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?	It's alive!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the sedative ready!	MMmmm!  MMmmm!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that tune that you're playing	Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.	Ja, ja.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Extremely well.	How nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you have a pleasant trip?	Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?	I'm not sure I...get your drift.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.	Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Inga!	Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Inga, wake up!	What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?	Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ooh!	What a filthy mess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, Doctor!	Well, this explains the music.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, doctor!	Perhaps we'd better leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right here?	Raise the platform, hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reputation.  Reputation!	I thought it was wonderful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Doctor!	I think you've done it, master.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks that way.	What do you think we should do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	I think I'll...carry him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think you can sing it?	Me?  Sing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd be so nervous.	This is not the finals -- just sing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'	Stop -- singing!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right -- give it to him!	Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!	Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you do it?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Doctor.	Good night!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.	Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.	Of course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Elizabeth has hers.	Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I have mine.	And I have mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes...yes, you have yours.	Why don't we talk inside?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?	MMmmm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready for me?	MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???	MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, not sound.	There must have been someone else down here then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His what??	His schwanzstucker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.	Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.	Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another fifteen seconds to go.	Do Something!  Stall them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir, name, please?	Food!
Do you have a reservation?	Food!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?	Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?	I'm explaining my reasons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
