<EOC>	<EOC>
You can ride like that?	I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.	Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhh, yeah it does.	You stay out of this, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...	... Will Perry ...

Hi, Rob and Carrie.	Go back to sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's freezing out.	You found us okay?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Let him go, Stan. I can help.	Go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary. What are you doing here?	She came to help, Howard.
<EOC>	<EOC>

What do you believe in then?	Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	American Cheese. The king of road food.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	I don't know, the screens are dead...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...	Trauma.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got a pulse, he's alive...	Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .	He's crashing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...	That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. I'm on the bridge.	What you got, Peters?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can anybody hear me...	Skipper...
Peters...	...you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any survivors?	Negative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you... She won't let you leave...	Son of a bitch!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	What is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
1500 meters. We're getting too close...	Where is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is now.  We're locked in.	Starck, give me a read.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain Miller...	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.	Keep him talking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The safety circuit's failed!	We're losing atmosphere...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it. Everything I want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't take this.	Ben. This is business. Just work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.	Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back it down, Johnny!	I can go hotter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Apparently I can disappear.	Please tell me you go silent too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --	Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, Sue...? I can't.	What? What do you mean you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found a broken gasket, from space --	A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just find him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?	Arnold. What's happening?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?	They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.	But they weren't mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad says you have to get up!	Ugh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor guy.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?	I don't know. I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I've got to go home.	Do you really have to go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shoot it.	Not yet. I want to study its habits.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Why what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The airport is over there!	Never missed a plane yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What made you do it? Who paid you off?	Nobody. I'm the maid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I see your license.	Of course, officer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all sure about this?	Follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohhh.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're better off.	Who's with me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on!	He's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gotta be close.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.	Just cover me. It was built to move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Push and twist, it's child proof.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanna see, baby?	Sure.
How much you got?	How much I got, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome back.	F-f-fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They were all over the place.	You smell like ass!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clever fuckers.	What the hell's going on here!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!	If he doesn't shut up...
<EOC>	<EOC>
SHIT.	MOVE YOUR ASS!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	She's not very nice, is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go!	Wait God-dammit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go! Go!	Not without you!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get to your cars!	GO-GO-GO!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know you don't have to do this.	I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.	We all have to be strong, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did we make it?	I think --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you an alcoholic?	No.
Were you a drug addict?	No. Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do, Dad?	You really want to go?
Of course.	And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.	...Then go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God, I look awful.	You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where to?	Oh Harry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it sound?	The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?	You got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say you promise.	I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You will honor your promise to me!	I will not! Kill me now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's beautiful.	She's not for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!	Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure it can't hurt us?	Nothing can. Not ever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!	The world is a dizzying place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've loved you all my life	All my life I've known.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brother and sister no more.	Now husband and wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Victor!	Open this door for no-one!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am not mad.	As a march hare.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.	Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Re-configure the leads?	Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Alice.	Good night, Brenda.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?	Un-hunh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Filmmaker.	Artist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go check on Brenda.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come?	Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said we were special.	I meant everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be okay. Holy shit...	Don't get up. Take a second...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roll him over!	Get behind him more.

You okay?	Those things can be nasty.

<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it feel?	How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what you think?	That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?	That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?	No, Richie, what do I look like?

<EOC>	<EOC>
May I get the check?	The ships are gaining...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	Nobody was WATCHING?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?	Down there.

<EOC>	<EOC>
The enemy is matching velocity.	The enemy is matching velocity.
<EOC>	<EOC>
THAT'S why you built this ship?	It's ... incredible.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. That was a good party.	You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.

<EOC>	<EOC>
"Since when is she an ""actress""?"	I know, she needs to die immediately.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!	We should follow them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Much later.	In fact, never.

Are you telling me how to drive?	No, I just thought --
<EOC>	<EOC>
And pure --	And decent.

Damn!	Are you all right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?	They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.

Jake?	How did you find me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wes, do me a favor.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Ratan?	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold it, mister.	What do you think of that? Or this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can fuck off, too.	You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.	Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, lady. Out.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?	No, thank you. I have my car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you dance?	What?
Do you sing and dance?	Eh, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Oh. Eh, I like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?	Well, I really don't drink...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.	But I don't play anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?	Superb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I <u>think</u> I see it.	Yes. It's almost there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure have a way with people.	Well, they're my species.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to marry the woman I love.	Harold!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you play?	No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.	Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Parasite!	Harold!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay where you are, Harold .	She took my head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!	I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes... Yes. You look...	Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a beautiful dress...	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So... You're Kirsty, huh?	You a doctor, too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm scared.	No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... G'bye.	It's been Hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't get psychic with me.	Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't look! Turn around.	Is it bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, may I go first??	Not so fast. He barely knows him --
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's dead.	Noooo! Noooo!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatcha looking at, John??	Oh-n-no -- I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to hold him down?	That's right, Stud, hold me down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's freezing, isn't it?	Coffee's warming me up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.	Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.	Oh, sod you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's my lucky day.	Hi.
Want to buy a bed?	Not much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me alone, will you?	No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody escapes us.	HE did. I've seen him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We want the man who did this --	No. That wasn't the deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please. Get back into bed.	I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.	It's important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.	No.
You remember.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come to Daddy.	This isn't happening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A long time.	You promised me an explanation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kirsty? It's very late.	Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?	I have to see my father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you?	In here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Just feeling a bit sick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- I'll go see.	No. I'll do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	Please...
What's wrong with you?	Please. I can't bear it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	We don't need a bed, do we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wouldn't believe me.	Try me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's there?	Daddy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to talk to you.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I have to get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going?	Just upstairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Steve. Thank God you came.	What happened to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Don't let them take me, Steve --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I always hated this song.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.	I should be so lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hey, how ya doin'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Marie.	Everything go alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you have more.	Well we don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then you must be at least 70 years old.	At least.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget it.	I'm just curious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Corey, you _owe_ me.	It's that important?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe him.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh please.  Another one.	What would you like?
Something pretty.	Like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David.	Do you have cause to bothering us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.	Have you time for some- thing to eat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have some unfinished business.	Are you here?
I want you to come to me.	And if I refuse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing to be sorry about.	Just your pappy scared some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hildy!	Hello, Bruce...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're Bruce Baldwin?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything the matter?	Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.	You haven't seen anything yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, she'll know some day.	That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call Duffy!	No, you don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Allow me.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she? Tell me!	Louie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about Bruce's?	Walter, you can't do that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But, Hildy -- I can explain --	You -- you!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!	You grey-haired old Judas!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know me. The shirt off my back.	You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.	I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?	Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I call. What you got?	Three bullets! Any good?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.	Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.	Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is this man?	Throw him out, Frank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look out, you --	What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother!	That man there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they gone? You know where they are?	Wait a minute, Mollie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look out!	Look out where you're aiming, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's true.	You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here? This is our territory	Looking for shrapnel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go and ask her if she wants to play.	Ask her yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did see them. I did.	He's the worst liar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't we just see the end?	They've got the real thing outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe this is happening to me.	It's not. It's happening to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now take deep breaths, and push.	Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He walks, duh.	Fucking great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a hitchhiker.	Way out here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She looks like she stinks.	Cat fight, cat fight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Almost there.	Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.	Where ya headed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go around him.	There's not enough room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.	Just sit back and enjoy the show.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much is a person supposed to stand?	Quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	Grab Mary and come inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I'm going fucking crazy.	I can't believe...
<EOC>	<EOC>
A couple hours!	Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.	Firefly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	George Willis...  ...any leads?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Turn up this road.	Where we headed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?	Over here, inside the smokehouse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ.	Call Wydell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wydell.	Excuse me for a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell him, Harold.	It's going famously, son, famously!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.	Shit.  Hi, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very well.	Very well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...	I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?	Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, how's it going today?	Good. Making progress.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's great. It's a great color for you.	Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	It's open...  What'll you have?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, mister.	The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?	Okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You quittin', friend?	Yeah, I'm quittin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?	Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you been all day?	At school. It's Thursday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...you shoot a great game of pool.	So do you, Fast Eddie.

Who is this?	My wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hell of a night.	You got that right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son ... are you awake?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.	I don't see anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No one comes here after dark.	Hide the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.	The back door was open.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is this?	So sue me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what?	Checkmate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.	Oh shit, we're late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is my wife in the air?	She should be shortly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they?	ETA with target; four minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it.	It's all fuzzy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.	And I am his.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.

Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Ark of the Covenant.	Are you sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't wander off.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said go around!	You said go between them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This.	The Grail Diary.

It's important!	Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --	Junior!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is you Junior!	Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?	I came to get you! What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it breaks the heart.	And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I'll never forgive myself --	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like Indiana.	We named the dog Indiana.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.	Come on -- come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going after those horses.	I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.	But, Indy --
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your last chance.	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you look at, Indy?	Just a statue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come one, what's wrong?	Behind you!

What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!	The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	It's starting to let go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Couldn't keep away, huh?	Just try and control yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Primitive sexual practices?	You're talking to an authority in that area.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	What -- the bug?

<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean...just leave.	We get on a plane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	The beach.
The beach?	How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Eating sushi?	Just get there.

What's going on?	Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I'm falling asleep.	Pleasant dreams.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't move.	Just relax.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Minimal.	We made it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice touch.	And you said high school was boring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see that?	Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Done!	Let's move out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many?	Bring 'em all. Let's move!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry!	Faster! Don't we have another gun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It bought us some time.	And now we're all out of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing?	My job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yllo, what's your head count?	Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sergeant!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.	Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
<EOC>	<EOC>
See? We're not so bad.	Not so bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?	I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?	I think so, why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spunky . . .	She broke my fucking nose!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?!!	Just come on, I've got an idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.	Well, do something!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry! She's lost it!	So what else is new?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do?!!	Crutch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, sorry.	Who are you apologizing to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave him behind!	No! He's coming with us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The power's back up!	Then open the doors!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What good will that do?	They can deal with this sort of thing.
More soldiers?	Scientists. Very intellegent men.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?	Hockey player? He's not a ...
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!	Old Earth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we get through these?	Sure but what good will that do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that one, there?	Tattoo. Had it taken off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about us?	Have to pump her steady, s'all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's comin' up -- !	He's taken him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only 24 hours!	I didn't agree to that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.	Let's all have a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?	They must've hit something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell?	It's a whale out there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?	Twenty years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's heading under -- !	No way! He can't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?	I don't have it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?	I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.	I'm not hungry, oddly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.	Oh really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. I'm here for the big show?	Your name, please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Penny Saver sucks.	Yeah, but it sucks for free.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.	Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lose!	I suppose anything's possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You dropped this.	Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The police are after him, he's a murderer!	...That's not true.
What?	That's not true!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?	Almost.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if they're dangerous?	They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Mind if I hold that Bible?	What do you need a Bible for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't hurt.	How much do I owe you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.	Thanks. What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All set?	Fuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You thirsty?	Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You got any money?	Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?	Unzip my pack, yo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.	Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.	Right now?
Yeah. Come on.	Hold on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I've been thinking about you lately.	You have?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.	At the block party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Telly is at Steven's?	I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.	What?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...	I tested positive?
I'm sorry.	But I only had sex with Telly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By yourself?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Casual.	Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?	You are!  I don't like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got it on the board.	No, I need the original note.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes you are.	Get off me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.	But a hundred men could move him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like my dad?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, dad.	My cheering section.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, dad?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.	That's a big area to cover.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another one?  What word did he leave?	"""Is"".  Did you tell him about the institute?"
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a good play, but risky.	You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?	No.  But I'm open to distractions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Can I come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You beat him.	I got lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.	Never mind my ears! Go away!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...	Colwyn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colwyn ...	You must move away from the Center.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the Arctic ice.	That way. I can feel the cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't reach her.	What do you see?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The spiral begins in the west.	Where the spiral begins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They can be saddled.	You have done it?
I road them often in my youth.	Saddles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.	You will not, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not hungry.	Not sleepy, either?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were attacked in the forest?	Yes. We lost five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kegan!	It is too late. He has drunk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The yellow and pink.	OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's incredible! How did you do it?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm going to kiss you.	Mathilda, stop, please!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He probably just went somewhere.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you two planning kids?	Maybe later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to finish first.	I won't let you die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mine.	Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do love you... very, very much.	Show me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walk with me?	You like to take walks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The beach of Pacifica, California.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.	So I've been informed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they standing?	Saluting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are a lot of people worried about you.	Where am I?
In a hospital.	Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I really want that watch.	This isn't right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a drink? I'm having one.	A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If I was I'm sorry.	No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you like me, Ben?	Don't be silly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sera... what you don't understand is...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please!	Yes... I'll give you that.
Thank you, Sera.	Do you want me not to go tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are limits.	Yes... I guess I knew that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes? What?	It's me, Yuri.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you with another man?	Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.	Are we done for today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dewey Newcomb?	Who's askin'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ready?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You almost had me fooled.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ask.	I wasn't gonna --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?	No, she can't move for an hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back up. How do you know he's gay?	Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!	What, like on va-kay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Class schedule, map, book list.	Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look -- nice.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In court. On opposing sides.	Are you serious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn you!	We're both of us damned, my beauty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.	Better we eat him than the other way round.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.	Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should hope not!	Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we trust him?	No... but what choice have we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.	Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're these?	They'll do nicely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were dead... I --	I was bewitched... it's better this way...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marco!	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that for?	Mom said I should.
Oh.	I would have anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom?	Here, honey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I couldn't get it to go down.	And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.	You'd better call and cancel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing up so early?	I couldn't sleep last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Atonement.	Who are all these people?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to ask like that?	I want you to try something with me, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should stay.	I don't know.
Where's your dad?	He jumped into the ocean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you remember me from when you lived here?	Yeah.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.	Really?
I wanted him to marry her.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you?!	Floating to Catalina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you guys' friends?	We've known each other since grade school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Alyssa here?	It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm leaving.	Hey...hey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good for you.	I haven't been touched in years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many bedrooms will your house have?	Three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should lock your doors.	Ring the bell before you try the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lock the door behind you.	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He never answers.	Why does he have a lock on his door?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Take it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've missed you guys.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I brought a few of my own.	Someone stop her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam, that's not true!	Yes, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I trust you, Claude.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got it... boss.	He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.	Winston. His name's Winston.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!	Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?	No problem. Oh, boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
All in, boss!	Move it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, the dude's holdin'.	Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Apparently, your sister died.	Jenny?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?	That's a long story...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?	Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ADRIAN!	You shouldn't have come here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now will you get in the flask?	Absolutely not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come you're not older?	Angels don't get any older, son.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knock, knock.	Yes, Jimmy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a good devil, Dad.	And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bus?	Beast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No wonder your uncle's so weird...	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.	Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look who's back from the dead.	Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looking for the chief.	We know where to find Nicky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta kill yourself.	I'll just go to Heaven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adrian?	Andrew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's freezing my hands.	It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to Jersey?	East Rutherford.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nicky!	That was Cassius!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you think we came from?	From? From? From?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have anything special in mind?	I don't care... Just get it over with.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You missed something special.	Well... you can't have them all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get that?	A Runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?	I let him go... believe me.
I don't..	Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
Please? What friends?	I don't have much time.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...	And I never heard of Sanctuary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you here to help me?	What do you need?
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you did know, you'd tell me.	Of course --
If you trusted me, you'd know.	We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Sandman.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you get here?	I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?	Gracious... no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want somethin'?	No, I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happenin'?	They're comin' with us.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm, okay... You okay?	Sure, I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a musician?	Yes, I thought my wife...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll keep a watch on the house.	As best we can.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?	Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	He won't give his name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where would you feel safe?	I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suit yourself, champ.	Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How ya doin', Pete?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why haven't you called me?	Sorry... I...

I was?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Lovey.	I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.	Good morning
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they? Do you see them?	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we going to do?	Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By the way, what religion do you follow here?	We follow many.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm thirty.	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which do you have your money on, Dee?	I'd go with number three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's marble.	All of it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!	Kay!?

<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	They're inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drop some money.	Forget that guy --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.	What --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somewhere near the capital?	No maglev system.
The mall?	Georgetown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red Ball?	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won!	What a big boy.  How old are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you have to.  They said you would.	The precogs were wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do I even know which one has it?	It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?	The female.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, sir.	My God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have an emergency call on your private line.	Thank you.  This is Burgess.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Ricky's not wearing one.	Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not my daddy.	You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey?	Where were you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.	Hi. I'm Jimmy.

<EOC>	<EOC>
When will he be able to write?	What's he got to write, for God's sake?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.	We could steal one of the choppers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a second...	I can't... couldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.	I though you said we didn't have a drop.

Hi.	I thought you'd chickened out on me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Alone tonight?

It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.	Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You're welcome, Unc.	What about me?

Keep the change.	Don't think I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the shine.	Thanks for the tip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stole that.	No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got this under control?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?	Help me get her off the rug.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Twenty-five wives!	And he killed every last one of 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothin'.	Come to me, boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?	But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just a stupid cat.	Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?	Because he was scary, that's why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, it's dark in here.	Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She dreamed this would happen...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Great
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never touched her.	You were screaming like crazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone else was there.	The door was locked from your side.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's cutting our throat...	But what can we do?... We have to accept.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!	And they might believe her in Moscow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a lovely room you have here.	How many families live here with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, monsieur?	Just looking around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.	Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comrades! Comrades!	Darling, darling... please!
I must talk to my brothers!	Shhh! Shhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.	No. Nobody will find us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Leon!	Good morning, Swana.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, please...	What do you want?
May I have your bags, madame?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't touch Hoover --	I thought the gloves were off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I say something, Mr. President?	There's no secrets here, Al.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Richard ... come with me, would you ...	Why me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.	Is it my turn?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But it was all we had.	... but it was all we had.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hello ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll do it.  No more.	Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.	Is that the truth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.	No ID in her room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?	I don't know. My mind wanders.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about yours?	I'm hidin' behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you buy that gun?	No. I found it.
Llewelyn!	What? Quit hollerin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Not we, you. Stay with your mother.	Well -- how come?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm-hm.	Screwgie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?	Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.	Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?	I seen you was from Dallas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's me.	I got beers in my room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would he go to Odessa?	To kill your wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You didn't take the product, did you?	What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.	No I don't have it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter here?	I begged him to let me put that on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She called you 'George,' George.	...did I win some contest?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Relax, we brought the cash.	I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!	You told me how to do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.	Should I kill him now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a really shitty thing to do.	I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd they describe her?	You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seems like a nice place.	It is, if you like idiots...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?	You mis'able little sneak thief...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right!	That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.	Good Lord, what do we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.	Gopher, Everett?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...	Everett, my beard itches.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!	Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!	Okay, Pappy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sayin' we har this man away.	Assa good idea, Pappy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was a moment a weakness!	Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!	But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?	No, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mayo, are those your friends?	Yes, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was you guys, huh?	Come on. Let's go dance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.	Hey, will you just leave me alone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Are those for me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.	Hey, Sid, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!	Shhhh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you guys still awake?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That isn't true, is it?	A little.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should see the look on your face.	The fuck did you do that for?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's gonna handle it.	She better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's never coming out.	Hey.
And we're never getting in.	Do me a favor and don't talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Push that button for me, will you?	Don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Too many stairs.	Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.	Well, I know that now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck him.	Don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't hear a thing.	What do they want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you freaking out?	Little bit.  Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got him!	Come on, come on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I saw something, I saw...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... is it loaded?	"I tell you ""officer"", it wasn't..."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey... what the hell you doing?	Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Motherfucker... you stay away...	Look this is bull...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you shoot the officers in question?	Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We appreciate your help with this.	So what's the deal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up with you?	Nothing.
"You got something on your mind... ""brother."""	"Yeah, ""brother"" My best friend is stone dead."
<EOC>	<EOC>
God damn it's him. I gotta go.	Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.	You're in no condition to ride.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father...	It's already over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go in there.	Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Francis.	Goodbye, Harry.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Reverend.	I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.	Remember Braddock?
That bad?	Worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.	Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No-I guess not.	Yayyy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good God! Where'd you hear that?	Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.	Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!

Where did he go?	The trunk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.	Thank you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't believe this is happening...	Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Things do change.	I guess they do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could have you fired right now.	You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.	Don't worry, four eyes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What in the hell?	Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I better go, Stew.	I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.	So, it's obvious, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's an excellent idea.	Oh, hello Mother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, when are you quitting?	Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, outside!	I beg your pardon, sir?

It goes away ... It'll go away.	I don't want it to go away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Sue--C'mon ...	What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...	So.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't! Just let go.	It's better, Mary Sue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want some bridge mix?	Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...	I'm fine--but thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I've got something to say.	Very well ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello Bud.	Hello Mr. Simpson.
Hear your Dad got a new car.	Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme see that.	No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.	Just take deep breaths.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jen, listen ...	I like--really need a cigarette, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmmgh.	Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.	You don't know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I open it?	Sure ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long do you think you've been here?	I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have the lettuce?	... Yeah.
Have you cooked the burgers?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what I really like?	... What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye.	Call me later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's Barry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ok?	I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.	What is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we agree that that is that?	That's that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doin' Barry?	Hi Walter.
How's business?	Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't turn us out, Abbe.	"""Turn you out?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?	Because your writing continues, unchecked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's no secret that you loved her.	Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --	-- that was lust --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Abbe de Coulmier!	I'm here.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm hungry for a proper visit.	Don't start --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?	....shame on you, truly...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep filming.	I can't remember the lines!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you back	Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I'm sorry.	I don't care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."	Again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."	Again
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you better sit down	I don't want to sit
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take off my pants.	Jake...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I went out.	What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Tommy. How are you?	Jake, sit down for a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By the way  what happened to your leg?	I was jaywalking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel a little foolish?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who said they left then?	Who left -- where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever own a saw?	Well, in the garage, back home, we --
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I'm not a killer!	Your logic is backward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you two talking about?	Got a shovel?
No.	There's probably one in the basement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you need money for?	To bail Lisa out of jail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No comment.	Don't you see how silly you're being?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What for?	Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	A new disease.
Friend of yours?	I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.	I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel okay?	Give me some dirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know something?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just him.	Stay there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse us a minute?	Sure.  Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he there?	No, honey.  No, he's not here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm here.	They're still there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?	Not lately.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!	Just tell a little white lie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Things pretty tough for you at home?	She eats him alive and he takes it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.	Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.	Yes, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't talk underwater!	I bet you hear everything I say!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's being called for.	You said you'd call my father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't you forget something?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??	YES!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
NO!	NICK!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the hell off of me!	Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We walked the place for a week.	And I worked there. For a year.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?	Don't tip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...so where is he?	Where is he?! Where is he?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't move, Rudy!	Standing right here, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.	I'M NOT NICK!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.	That's okay, Eddie, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For what, the cops?	Nice Guy Eddie.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I found their surrey --	So did I. They were in it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd they go?	Swimming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not giving up?	How many ways can a man say no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know who we are?	Everybody knows --
<EOC>	<EOC>
How far up the trail?	I don't know -- I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got company. Female company.	Yeah, we sure have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doin' --	Lookin' around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.	Thanks, Steve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I won't let you do it.	Alex, what are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about you, Buddy?	Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's here.	Shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hanson, please.	Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm telling you, it was possessed.	Theo, did you see the animal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I take it you're not mad at me.	I wouldn't go that far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you working on?	Just a little experiment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?	Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh... I'm Father McFeely	Father, come in, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh shit, you gonna take that?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo son, check this out.	Dog, you look hot.

Sorry, y'all. My bad.	Shorty, why don't you say grace?

Chip, honey?	Thanks, Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's gonna kill Scotty!	BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chip, your ride is here.	Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.	Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!	Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
MOTHERFUCKER!!	COCKSUCKER!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Murder, honey.	Now, here's a babe!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much does she want?	She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.	She can only use cash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what this is, Frances?	I ought to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.	I'd like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it about Jacqueline?	No. She's no longer under my care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.	All of these are interviews?
Yes.	Can we look at one?
No.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Graham...	I'm okay. It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddam right.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's my share of the dress?	Thirty-two dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye.	Bye.

You bet, Bert.	Good!  I'm gonna be there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!	What's cookin', Bert?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Infantile regression.	You got it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?	I've caught it once or twice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A free thinker.	Everything's free there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT	SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
<EOC>	<EOC>
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
<EOC>	<EOC>
But they only think they're happy.	That doesn't make sense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my poor baby.	Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I NEED SOME	YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME	YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME	YOUNG BLOOD

CRIMINAL	SIN-I-FUL
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm thinking about the duck breast.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.	Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you smell?	I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you chewing gum?	Want some?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. Tight.	Pour us a couple.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.	Well, she is cute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you?	Bathroom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.	Hold on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm having the salmon.	That's what I'm having.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you think?	Quaffable but far from transcendent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you, Miles. You take care.	Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miles, when are you going to get married again?	I just got divorced. Phyllis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's dust in it.	This one?
A hair.	This one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The same windows.	That's weird.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think it's a possibility?	Yes.
How can you say that?	That wasn't the answer you wanted?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you feel comforted?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merrill --	I'm looking!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's good enough for me.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morgan?	It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.	Where are we going to sleep?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that him?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Emmett.	McKendrick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we?	Someplace safe. How you feeling?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gotta go.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your brother?	He'll be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The jury saw it differently.	So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.	I was afraid of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why him?	Shut up. You need help, don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, it's working out real good.	Where's Emmett now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing like that will happen between us.	Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.	No problem.  Do you want to come in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- You can't go in there!	-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Simone.	She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank Simone for the tickets.	It was a great show, Dad...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.	Just a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.	Er,... good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's take it down a notch.	-- What you don't understand --
<EOC>	<EOC>
--My God.	--Do I know you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, Malcolm.	Goodnight, sweetheart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All your soldiers speak Latin?	No, just one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't know you were funny.	I forgot myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish I were somewhere else.	Where will you go, where no one has died?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go home, okay?	I definitely won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cole, you're scaring me.	They scare me too sometimes.
They?	Dead people.
Dead people?	Ghosts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you thinking, Momma?	...I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.	Oh yeah? Why's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bitch.	Slut.
Witch.	Tramp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dammit, Carl!!!!	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Peggy-Sue"" --"	"-- ""Billy-Jean"" --"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!	I thought you said two hundred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, there goes our record deal.	Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should we be doing this, dude?	Metaphysical question, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be back.	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow!	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!	Amen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck you talking about, man?	He's right. You were behind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here.	No. Not without you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.	Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?!!	Spider.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.	What'll we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you nodding?	Yeah.
I can't hear when you're nodding.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the old half--Mexican?	Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I ask you something?	Shoot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you learn how to drive like this?	Like what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm proud of you.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's just exhausted.	That man is your father?!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Order up!	That's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?	Another time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hit the brakes!	They're jammed!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We still on schedule?	Forty-two minutes ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate to say I told you so.	Save it. We got a long haul.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never mind. It's nothing.	Anything else you don't want me to know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.	Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.	I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bandit II?	I'm here.
You're coming up to the scale house.	I'm cucumber cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.	And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You investigating those murders out at the lake?	Ww... uh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got concerns.	...About what?
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.	I'm not doing cocaine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About what?	Look at the collar on that coat...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...	They what? What? No. No. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Israel?	What are you doing here?
My debrief --	-- will be handled back in --
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Does he know?	...He does now...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You killed her!	Not her.  It.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to stay here?	Do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claire!	Hello, Win.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never seen anyone killed before.	It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You live in Manhattan?	Queens... You know Queens?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.	I came on at 8:00.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	They called here after you left...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It wouldn't work.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You still going away?	I don't know...
You don't have to, now.	I think it's probably still a good idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?	Sure we are, let's go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Flash isn't?	Be nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was there.	See?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flash, get lost.	Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now tell me you love me.	Lemme down, bugface!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.	Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit down and stop being such a child.	This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, Roz.	Any sign of our friend?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?	Precise equipment such as waldos
<EOC>	<EOC>
The record--	It'll shut itself off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up here, Docky Ocky!	No, no!  Not there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.	Looks good outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put me down for ten, you louse.	I'll call the whole pot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's blow, Chauncey.	Let's!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up, Animal!	Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Animal.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me do it, Hoffy.	You want to go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're stuck with me, eh?	Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's working.	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Target their Bridge.	Full disruptors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I get it. I get it.	You get what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?	That's right.
Close to retirement?	I hadn't planned on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir?	Make it so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks like we're too late.	There are no other ships in the system.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Transwarp at your command, Sir!	Execute!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...	A photon tube...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Scott?	I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --	Aye, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God...	Much is at stake...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...	Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.	Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...	You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.	But, why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Until now.	We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David --	Mother, go back!
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!	What's the matter -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't mean to intrude.	Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir -- our shields are dropping!	Raise them --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Departing dark side, Regula.	Visual --
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll lose them if they go in there.	Rake her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time's up, Admiral...	Here it comes. Now, Spock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just barely, sir.	I'm going down to the station.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?	Yes, SIR.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is the word given?	The word is given: warp speed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.	Steady as you go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'	'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cease fire. Look sharp.	Power levels quite low, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Sulu... The shields!	Trying, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.	Try again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.	Aft thrusters, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All moorings are clear, Captain.	Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wake up, man, wake up!	Come on, Pavel...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're saying... It is a compliment.	It is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No choice now, Scotty!	Sir, heat shields at maximum!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you were at Berkeley.	I was not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?	A spaceship with a missing man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God, we're too late!	Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Warp two... three...	Steady as she goes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Transparent aluminum?	That's the ticket, laddie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes... that looks like them.	What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'	From the mission...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll order Riker to turn around.	Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're powering their forward weapons array.	Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'	Deck ten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name is Sojef, Captain.	Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?	No, we're here to... rescue them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...	Beam him out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?	No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...	But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?	Or you could try lying down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Initiate launch sequence.	Activating injector assembly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't it better like this...?	Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What year is it?	According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.	As they used to say... all systems are go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ATR setting...	Active.
Main bus...	Ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Life signs?	Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Target locked!	Fire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Report.	We're still in Earth orbit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I remember it made me sick.	What are you suggesting?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worf? Is something wrong?	Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I believe the operation is over.	The charge is murder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.	We're not finished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...	No way.  You see this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damned clever if you ask me...	Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?	Barely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll respect him now...	That's a comfort...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you care to go topside?	Very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are those your words?	Yes.
Spoken by you?	Yes...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.	Those words WERE spoken by me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is Mr. Sulu?	Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's here - somewhere.	But if she's cloaked...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, sir.	Mr. Valtane, any more data?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.	Onscreen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.	He's got it.
And your coat.	Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is incredible -	WHO ELSE...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, sir.	Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?	I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope you're happy.	Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Control tower, reading, Sir.	Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her own father...?	Such things have happened before, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
NO WAY!	Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Data!	Sorry, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.	Negative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have this dance?	With pleasure, Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can you be certain?	I know how he thinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To find the head, sir?	If you don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Strength in numbers?	We can only hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Praetor?	I've never met a human woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
After you, Praetor.	Age before rank, Jean Luc.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Report!	Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So theyve got him up and running.	He's a very unusual android.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!	She is here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did I tell you?	Probably kids.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...	Don't... don't do this... please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah... no...	Ah no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?	We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In your pocket, please...	You. Mouth closed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Candy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I was afraid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Are you my friend?
Yes.	I am your friend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like this music.	I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?	I feel better if I move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get that, Lyman?	We're ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?	Forget it's there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.	I intend to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's his name?	Fumitsu.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And gives it to you.	Wants to share.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No more, Lenny.	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the original.  There are no copies.	Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.	See you downtown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been looking for you.	Why me? What do you want from me!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was sitting here?	It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?	Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.	I don't believe this.
I'm hesitant to...	Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.	Where's my watch? It's gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?	Because you asked him to, stupid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it, Mike.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
I'm Mike.	Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?	Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.	I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.	Why? You're not a real man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	You want this in black chips.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, it's just that...	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?	I'll be your winger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't been drinking, have you?	No. Just O.J.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who threw this party, anyway?	Damned if I know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vegas, baby!	Vegas!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vegas.	Vegas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wake up, baby.	Whu?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got the digits, baby.	What a surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, don't mess with me right now...	We're not messing with you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.	Oh. He's got it under control...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bitch... You little bitch!	Chelios to Roenick...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...against the computer.	They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!	Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it's on, baby...	...It's on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes she did.	Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is on.	...it is so on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you?	I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...	Go back to your house and wait for me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Godfather!	You have to answer for Santino.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see you have your Luca Brasi.	I'll need him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.	No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are those girls?	That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.	Mike!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't...	Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?	OK.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your sister wants to ask you something.	Let HER ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do.	What are you doing in Mongi?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Tom.	Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.	Did you speak to my father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think you can steer this thing?	Sure.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.	What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.	Aye, aye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never said that!	Bird. That's jazz.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really should go in, it's marvelous.	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this you?	No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?	Where have you been since then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ditto.	Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tom, are you okay?	You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?	I give up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?	He'll, what else can I do with it all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is sort of high class...	I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...	My God!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Travis.	Hello, Betsy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Betsy, come over here a moment.	What is it? I'm busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
20 bucks?	Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that so?	What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sport. How are things?	O.K., cowboy.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?	What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.	Iris?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Had a close one.	You want to talk about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's me sir.	What is happening?  Where's Mason?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Now they only have three rockets left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?	Delly?  In here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.	Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you two get out there and dance?	Oh, no, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	The film broke...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Call me... Ishmael?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's my r-r-rent.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, sit.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.	The customers?  I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?	I thought you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?	Yes, I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I did.	Just listen to them!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	The little Brenner girl.
Lois!	It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!	It's Alice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cut yourself outside, Miss?	Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... well, is everyone all right?	I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a chimney swift, all right.	We know what it is, Al.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that for Mitch Brenner?	Yes.
He's not home.	That's all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some cream?	I'll get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When will they stop?	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?	Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.	How about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd better light some of those lamps.	No... wait.  Hold me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you plan to do that?	With smoke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's unconscious.	Pulse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Toddy hates me.	Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.	We have never been friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think maybe knives do?	Keep that thing away from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where it happened. Right over here.	Yeah, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweetheart...	Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you an FBI man?	No -- I'm afraid not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think they'll ever find him?	I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?	Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.	You better get some fresh air.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	He's my brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.	Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All together?	Zero.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.	No.  Stick around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that smell!?	Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... And stay outta here.	You have a T.V.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He looks dead.	He's just a deep sleeper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lights out, Sam.	Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.	C'mere, Nanook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say hello to Thorn.	Hi, Thorn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not impressed, are you?	Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?	Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David's looking for me... I have to go.	You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.	Wanna go to the comic book store?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm making you a sandwich.	Don't bother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where these tracks headed?	Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Torch them!!	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should have jumped his ass.	Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God, what in hell happened here?	Come on, Copper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And if anyone tries to wake me...	Damn you, MacReady!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long will it take you to prepare this?	A couple of hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody definitely messed with it.	We going to make it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were the flashlights?	Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it ain't coming.	Then we go after him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because you'll never die.	Excuse me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, the moment is rather dying here.	Hold on... I know I have it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know it's not a diamond but --	A moonstone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex, what is it?	Holding you... again.
Darling.	I need... to talk to you.
All right...	Not here... alone.  Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let them.	I have something for you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear me, lad?	All right, all right -- here -- everything --
<EOC>	<EOC>
His curiosity is amazing.	Mm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.	Here?
Yes, sir, he --	Tell him to go away --
<EOC>	<EOC>
My fowl have polluted the yard.	Dean Fulton...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --	They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --	They're inside --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I can remember what's on them.	William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're not here.	They're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What case?	I was working with a boy named Eugene.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who...who kills me?	You have nothing to fear, William.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tried to kill my wife.	Don't you go to jail for that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gonna be sticky.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is pretty good. Considering...	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, good for you.	[Beat] Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been better.	You girls are in some hot water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	You want to come on in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello...	Who is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I just ask you one other thing?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to your hair?	Nothing.  It got messed up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	Lemme see the map.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Louise?  Where are we?	Just past Boise City.
Idaho?	Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Nothing.  It's not funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry!	Sorry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.	Are you alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't it beautiful?!!	It's grand!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well then you've got to call her, man.	Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why's that?	I'm usually too tired to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.	Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?	Pat Healy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?	What do you mean 'why'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ho-ly shit.	Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So who's the lucky guy?	Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Good lookin'?	He's no Steve Young.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pat's an architect, too.	Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Ted.	Hi, Mary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ted...?	I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Franks and beans!	Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Kenny. It's over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it about?	Cuba.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.	I, uh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.	I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Couldn't sleep.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meet me at base. Over.	Cooch. You're my hero.
<EOC>	<EOC>
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll sleep around a little.	Thanks, Cooch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Ray. Come forward.	No way, Cooch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?	After we've completed our investigation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	You're steppin' on sign.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take care of yourself, Walter.	Likewise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?	We're going for The Stronghold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way. No fuckin' way.	How the hell do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two.	Two miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
It dies. We live.	You're an animal.
That's true. What are you?	I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Danger?	. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?	Why, what's gonna happen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't shake him.	WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
<EOC>	<EOC>
MAVERICK.	YEAH, COUGAR?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm pulling up.	No! Now we're inverted!
<EOC>	<EOC>
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! Not again!	What are you talking about, we gotta go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So I've heard.	Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.	No shit. The Iceman....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!	Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
3000 feet. I'll do it.	Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hear about Ice?	What now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.	NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.	Tell me one thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel?	All right.
Goose is dead.	I know. I was there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Skipper, sorry to bother you.	No bother.
I called your house.	My wife's house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with this one?	He ain't got five kids to feed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome to Mars.	What was that?  An accident?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.	Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?	Definitely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go encode your room key.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.	Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.	Sleazy...and demure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.	Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.	Watch your mouth, Captain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.	This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They found us!  Everybody out!	Melina!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Quaid!	Harry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	I've got Quaid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not at ground level.	Up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at this shit.	What the hell is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is she?	Nobody.
Nobody?!  What's her name?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?	Blondes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said get out!	Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
And no one found the ring?	No, sir, we did not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sort of shorthand.	Shorthand. Really?
We're heading into a difficult situation.	How do you figure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe I better start our homework.	Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.	Sure. What do you want me to call you?

What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Tomorrow night.	No.  Tonight.  It's important!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And...what's the man doing?	Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why does God let there be bad things?	I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Darker.  More...evil?	Yeah...how'd you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know how Chase really died.	What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.	Yeah, sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heather, what is it?	Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did we lose anybody?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...	Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...	Give me some time to blow the man down...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Make us proud.	Yes sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Yeah.  How'd you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
They tell you that?	I figured it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, man?	I don't have to listen to this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tie it off!!	Outer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.	No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it going to be?	I'm sorry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you hating this?!  Are you!	I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Whisper it... Whisper ""fuck me""... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper..."	Fuck me.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?	Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want me to get that?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that?	Well done, James.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't this...?	Hm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor Tripp...?	Yes, James.
<EOC>	<EOC>
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.	James'll know about George Sanders.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Grady!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Emily left me this morning.	She's left before...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's gun is that?	It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you riding with me, James?	No, I'm going ho --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cherry.	Huh?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.	It's a nice table.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got some good news.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you glad?	When?
Soon.	Next week? The week after?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean?	I mean... feelings.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you writing in that book?	It's my bird book.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.	Robin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The passionate one?	Yes.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.	I count my blessings.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. How are you adjusting?	I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?	Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?	It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen Walter?	Lovers' quarrel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's her name?	Ms. Kramer.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	What did you think would happen?
I don't know.	What did you want to happen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who do you see?	I see my sister.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Are you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never spoke to me before.	I thought you were a dyke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You plan to drink both those beers?	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something happened to you.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, you're not a dyke.	Not tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the worst thing you ever did?	The worst?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never hurt them. Never.	Twelve years in prison?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, this is crazy.	What?
Being here, with me.	I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.	What odds?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't even know how to live with myself.	Just think about it.
I've got problems.	Who doesn't?
Most people don't have my kind of problems.	Guess that makes you pretty special.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	What's it look like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't sleep well.	Do you want to talk about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You done impressing yourself, ace?	No way that could just be seawater.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got it?!  You got it?	Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.	Not for long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.	Yeah?  Well I'm not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son of a bitch!	Calm down, Bud.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is insane.	It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.	I can't... make it... podner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quiet!  Quiet!	Turn it up, bozo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SHIT!	Give me that!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
But where are you going?	I'm thirsty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one shall I wear?	This one is gorgeous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claudia, aren't you coming?	I'm certainly not going to swim across.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?	Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?	I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's as smooth and slick as oil.	I detest comparisons made with oil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll stay here also.	But why?... What if it starts to rain?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zuria?	Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.	Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm being punished.	Why?
I don't know.	Dear Jesus...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have a lovely voice.	No I don't.
I just heard you.	That wasn't me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know a Marie?	No... do you?
Why should I?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Someone's following me.
Who?	Sister Marguerite I think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agnes, can you hear me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	If I find anything I'll call you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, no...	I can get you new evidence next week.
No!	Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh that one there, in the corner.	The one up on the third floor?
Yes.	Uh huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's absurd!	That possibility never occurred to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll see about that.	Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.	The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.	I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.	You crawler.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you two like a cup of tea?	You see, sly villains.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?	Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now get on with it.	We were going to do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.	Sit down, the lot of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's my grandfather?	Don't start. Look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop picking on him.	I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, you want to watch it.	It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.	I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go first.	No, you'll follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Breathe deeply.	<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have recorded the transmission.	Play it for us, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Computer, what language was that?	Unknown.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did it come from?	<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What common objects?	Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't count on it.	We sure need this flamethrower.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That way.	You lead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	My signal's fading.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's close, real close.	How far?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell happened?	Engine room, what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Hey watch it</u>!	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get back and call this in.	Wait a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?	Okay, give me the numbers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found it...	And?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.	Get her on-line.  Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Guttierez?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They knocked out the external feeds.	Looks like it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've found Ackland!	Hold on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going?	Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feeling better, my dear?	Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was magnificent.	Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.	You were there? At the play - last night?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've already met.	Where?
Right here. A minute ago.	That's nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck, genius...	Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy little housewife...	Cut it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, what's your name?	Eve. Eve Harrington.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for your help... good luck.	Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Birdie-	Hmm?
You don't like Eve, do you?	Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.	No.
Why not?	Now you want an argument.
She works hard.	Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-	Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?	Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Miss Channing.	My husband...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?	It couldn't possibly interest you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have your coat?	Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations, Eve.	Thank you, Karen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... it started with the play before this one...	'Remembrance'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coming?	In a minute...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it? What's it all about?	Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karen and I just don't want an accident-	I have no intention of having an accident!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?	I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Republican?	Sure.
Who'd you vote for?	When?
'68.	Nixon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll give us a sworn statement.	We're inside the White House now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You overslept?	Goddamnit!--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?	Well of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Speak.	We've just been talking to Young--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--and we got a guy in Justice--	--Deep Throat?--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've really got to go.	Just let me get a match.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--who you got?--	--well, Sloan--
<EOC>	<EOC>
--which Young?	Larry Young, a California lawyer--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great evening, isn't it?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had no idea you'd be this good!	Neither did I!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is your plan, Finch?	Yep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you suppose they're saying?	No idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you love my sexy body?!	I do, baby, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, minuteman.	Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know that?	She's already on a plane back home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I come in?	Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?	Dad, come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	These are for you.  From father to son.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You guys got the Latin homework?	No -- Kevin, you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?	Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.	You think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me know.	Okay, don't stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!	Just a second!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now?!	No...I know the perfect time...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You comfortable?	Yeah, are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.	Yeah, the time went by so fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So does your tongue cramp up?	Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.	He didn't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
God. How can you eat like that?	It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?	Yeah. Apparently.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because, Andy. It's a cure.	A cure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope they fucking fry us all.	Yeah. French fries...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy mother of God...	Fuck me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't even have to ask.	All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
God. I can't believe it.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
These tunnels must loop around and connect.	Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The ADM. Let's go.	Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ha. Some wonder drug...	Why isn't it doing anything!?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You recognize her?	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -	Allo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	Okay. So maybe you were right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.	Double merde.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a princess...	Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, this place is great.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.	Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I'm sorry!	Don't get upset!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.	Tell him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, watch the road!	You'll total the whole car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!	His wife has diabetes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.	I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?	I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?	Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?	Absolutely.
Had a little help?	Absolutely not.
It has your ring.	I'm not that good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not.	This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That for us?	What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?	Sally?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The suspense is killing me.	Harry called.
And?	Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.	She's in ICU.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You need to call your dad.	Leave us alone right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cal, my wife Judy.	Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.	I'll say as little as possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the kitchen.	Who'd like to go and find Otis?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dolphins.  Great.	It's ecstasy, Sal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't say a word.	Time!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ.	Well...wow...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, yes, actually.	He always has two or three going...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!	Don't go in, Ryan.
What?	Let's just go home, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ryan!	Are you working on a new book?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Well, so glad you decided to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, did you hear what he said?!	Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wear this.	You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.	What do I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So this is your mother's apartment?	That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right? What's the matter?	Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
<EOC>	<EOC>

So what are you doing with a dog?	Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?	Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.	It's okay -- I'll sit here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you'll be at work?	Yes.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I carry bacon in my pocket.	Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.	Come on, sweetheart...

<EOC>	<EOC>
What the -- ?!	So you agree you need help?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll get something for us to drink --	Don't bother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're really into God, right?	In ten words or less?
Yeah.	My relationship with God is my own.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.	Don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe you inspire me.	That sounds like horseshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a start.	Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you're talking to me?	When I have something to say.

I don't understand...	Maybe you're not supposed to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I might do it wrong.	Not possible.

So talk to us about something.	Like what, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?	In there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.	She did. It was you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's polyester.	Poly-what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	Have we ever met before?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've gotta ask her to the dance!	Not now....

We did it, Ray.	You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to go for a ride?	Well, I got homework.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My stomach's growling.	There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he upset?	He didn't say anything to me about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Yes?
This your place?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!	Who're you?

Jesus... They can tell that...	They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus... You're leaving.	Have to, old timer. Just for a while.

<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you feel when he died?	I loved him.  I hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why does he do it?	To see if he can get away with it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your shoulder?	Fine.  How's your back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shouldn't play this game.	I don't have a choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's OK.  It's OK.	Make love to me.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	He was here.  Watching us.
Nomak?	He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?	Look, what's your problem?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Pointless.	No. I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Why she kills children.

Do I?	Like you're concerned.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean that?	Yeah.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Dil --	Where?

Now, that was worth waiting for.	Hurry up, would you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fergus?	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>

About how wealthy would you say?	I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?	I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?	I don't know.

<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you get here so fast?	I left like an hour ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you open?	Yes.
Just the paper.	Thirty-fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you go.	What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.	WHAT?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way!	Swear.  Olaf, metal!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he say?	I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure. How about the beach?	I like the way you think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!	Fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.	Where's the radio?

Then where the fuck is!	There.  You blind?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go after her.	Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This way.	Then go fetch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's alive!	He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening, my boy.	Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Vincent?	Yes, Max?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	No.
What you mean, no?	I'm done.  Find another cab.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was only going one way.	Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --	Just drop me off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Equitation.	I've been reading up on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	This way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liza?	Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?	Did you kill my father?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?	Because he believed me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I believe you.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They changed Franklin's portrait.	You think it's a conspiracy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liza, settle a bet for us.	What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Then this is a goddamn emergency.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.	Agent Lowry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way did he go?	I don't know.  Didn't see him.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.	It's so... small.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.	It was quite a page turner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell us about it.	You steal a car?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then how come it ain't done yet?	I don't know, Boss.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Stop that.	How about you tryin' to make me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate this...	Only kidding!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's good medicine.	A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me what to do!	I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.	I'd like to go back. James...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Crash victim?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up with you?	Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did the right thing.	I ruined your wedding night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must you walk so quickly?	It's good exercise, Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It had this red spot on its back.	Green spot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you're checking it out.	I've already checked it out 17 times.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really, this isn't funny.	OK, OK, I'll give it back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.	What are the delusions like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then it's over.	Lie down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me all.	I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So there were no problems?	Not a one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to see the kitchen first.	Do you like it?
I love your apartment.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet.	I'll be forced to tickle you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four interviews. Four no-gos.	The restaurant, too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?	It wasn't exactly a lie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't have a fever.	I don't feel like going to work today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Turn on the flashlight.	I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That moron.	It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, knock it off.	All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I knew I should have driven.	Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- I want to be Elvis.	It's my idea.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.	Okay.   You can be Elvis.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's good.	God, I want to go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?	Get in the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.	Watch this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we went the wrong way.	Oh, you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't sleep?	No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.	It's not your fault.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.	I didn't have the heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You're doing calligraphy?	I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	What I've always wanted, to teach you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit... you're dead, man...	Victims.  Aren't we all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cute nickname, don't you think?	I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got company.	Is he inside?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Annette, how long have we known each other?	Forever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry that was out of line.	I want to go home.
I was just kidding.	I want to go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, mom.	Honey, is something wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Greg, is that you under the covers?	Get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?	Could you be more desperate to read it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you calling?	Cecile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get off me!	Will you calm down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's desperate that I talk to her.	I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.	I'll do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.	Do you know where she is?
She's out.	Do you know when she'll be back?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -	Annette! Annette!
Young man, I already told you she's not here.	Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy --	Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?	Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?	Sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.	I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.	I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.	Oh, thank you, Amy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry, hurry.	Yes, yes -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother! You called me by name!	Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
<EOC>	<EOC>
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.	Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There was a sale.	I mean where on your body?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are all the mediums?	Frida, grab that red one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!	No they're not.

<EOC>	<EOC>
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?	No, I said it was our first date.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Do you wash your hands before you type things?	Why, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you think this goes?	It sure isn't the fun-fair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't let you in...  sorry.	I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see it?	Yes.
Where does it lead?	It must be a closet or something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you like.	You're supposed to be my doctor, right?

Known me for long?	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I have to go...

Good morning, Mr. McAllister.	Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You know what they say about the early bird.	Yes, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.	I've got an idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You dumbshit!	What'd I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you work for me?	Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?	How'd you get them to retract?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One in six.  Where's the girl?	Officer White, put down that weapon and --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Lynn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.	Which one are you and which one am I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's fine.	I'm not asking you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.	You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.	You, me and White, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell us about Rachel Banks.	Rachel Banks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gimme that.	You sure?
You're driving.	Those are Feds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty fast.	We'll have to re-stock some basics.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Mr. Dean.	Hello. Hello, Maria.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure you're safe?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.	It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.	Here, you can use this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My suitcase--	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.	Don't count on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't <u>give</u> me--	--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?	We'd rather not--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well we'd sure like to help you.	You would?
Yes. But we can't.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did he bring you?	A surprise, he said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.	Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you asleep?	Yes.  Dropping off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.	Would you like me to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kip - come and dance with me	Yes.  Later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is hot!	Nya-nya-nya!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's gone, hasn't he?	No.  He's - no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!	Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.	There are times when you don't answer the phone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're shaking. Are you nervous?	No. Why would I be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to die, aren't we...	I'm not the one to ask...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those are my clothes.	Certainly not mine. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's entrapment.	No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it.	Charged?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful not to break the laser beams.	Duh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
STOP! You're making...mistake.	It's your mistake.
The big job.	There is no big job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	A billion dollars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peoples China Bank.	Where the money is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do I look?	Like a woman of mystery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pulse detectors.	Charged.
Parachute.	Packed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have something in mind?	Call it a new tradition.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--You're a cop.	Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.	Remind me why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you.	Probably not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where've you been?	What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.	Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fax these to this number, okay?	All of 'em?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can put them in a good school.	Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When'd they file the demur?	Yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Ros, where are they?	In the conference --
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come her own mom isn't helping her?	Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing?	Better safe than sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.  It's an awful lot.	I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three patrol ships are heading our way.	Barks an argument and shakes his head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should have stayed and finished them off.	Barks his agreement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would it help if I got out and pushed?	Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you say?	I didn't say anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rather touchy, aren't they.	I thought you knew this person.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This hyperdrive had better work.	I've never seen it fail.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Plissken...?	I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.	It's history. I gotta go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it?	Right over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do we get out of here?	Sewers. Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All of us?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
At last...	Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A king must marry, after all.	...of course...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.	You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very well. Climb up.	I will run.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.	Twenty days!? The world is that big?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now you must pay me.	I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	In here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute you need two.	No you don't. I do it all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want it.	Honey it's to help you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think you can sleep?	Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
MERRIN!!!!!!!	Are you tired?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the gig?	Two nights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What d'ya got?,	Bosen black.  Flat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What d'ya got?	Yamaha white.  Nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.	Your doorbell doesn't work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell is she?	It's early.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.	She'll get here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something, huh?  All those bids.	Yeah.  Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.	You wanna get a drink?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?	Two years ago.  March.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have some more wine, Frank.	Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your limo's ready, Ma.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're an hour and a half late.	My watch is broken, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.	What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The switch.  Hit the switch.	Switch?  What fucking switch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess I ... If I jumped to...	Forget it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Funny hours.	Funny job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank said ---	Frank wasn't 'there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd the show go?	Okay.  How'd yours go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Big piece or little?	Huh? Oh, no.
None?	I'm not much for sweets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're wearing your suit --	Call me spontaneous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And I know people.	Im sure you do...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were almost done here...	Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do I go now?	Big Eds.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?	Thats where you work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got a minute, Jack?	Ive got all the time in the world...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finger food...?	I dont think so, thank you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...	If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	Yeah...fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of man does that!?	I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?	Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?	That is the general idea, yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need to tell you something.	Okay...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good things...	What are you sure about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This place is a perk, Kate.	A perk for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look great.	Its good to see you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to see you again.	I'd like that, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.	So we'll get egg nog.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't take this.	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it.  Everything I want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ben, come in.	What is this?  Where's Reed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.	But all these people...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're on fire!	Not this again --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --	No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.	What...?  <u>Oh</u>.

What are you doing?	Raising the shields.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay to proceed.	Phase Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Difficult? He's impossible!	That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen...the Heart.	Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.	Now I know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.	But I did. I'm positive!
<EOC>	<EOC>
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --	You left something out.
What's that?	The Breath of God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...	Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.	Then don't drift down further.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Is this a fucking joke?	Unghh... oh, geez...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unguent.	Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.

What... ?	Nothing.  Do what you like.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I asked you what you studied.	Tell him!
<EOC>	<EOC>

Ask me nicely.	Defuse the bomb, please.

No thanks.  I carry my own.	Excuse me?

<EOC>	<EOC>
You going to be okay?	Go on, 'they're stahting.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...	Yeah, let's bury her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A simple 'please' would suffice...	Fluck you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.	You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	There's that question...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Rennie...??	The window...

<EOC>	<EOC>
He carries a gun.	Then you should carry a gun.

Hello.	Jerome--?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good to see you're feeling better.	"Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your ""friends""?"

Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?	Six one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What makes them think that?	They found my eyelash.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You really had other offers?	I'm sure I could have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you, Jerome?	Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.	I could always walk.  I've been faking it.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?	This is my brother's car.

You're single?	Yes.
Where were you trained?	At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have the servants made you comfortable?	Yes, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.	I imagined this so differently...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night.	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready to go?	We're not going anywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you kids doing down here?	What do you think we're doing, dad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to follow me?	I dunno. I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
She your only sibling?	Twelve years younger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're sure it's hers?	Has her books in it.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	I told her to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forget your pager?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.	And something else that might interest you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thought I smelled something.	Good to see you, too, Randy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...	Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Randy Stetz is in jail.	Told you I could write an ending.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you that was an accident!	Then so was mine...
Don't you pull that shit with me.	I didn't want to kill her, Will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your back-up?	No back-up.
You're not following procedure.	Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're immortal. You've always known that.	Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's no vampire.	No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!	Be still!
<EOC>	<EOC>
They would have killed you -	Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come, you're going to feed now.	I want a woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen to me. He's here.	Who? Who is here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't kill me --	Wait, it's Nancy --
<EOC>	<EOC>
This was not my idea.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure it's okay with you?	Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think that's a good place to hide?	I don't know, but I'm starving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To a great weekend --	Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd Estes go?	What is up with that weirdo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Oliver.	Sleep well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.	Made what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Ernie!	Hiya, George!

<EOC>	<EOC>
Made up your mind yet?	I'll take chocolate.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You can?	You going to the lighthouse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When do we get to the lighthouse?	Soon, dark eyes, soon.

Right.	That's so cool.

Are you sure?	I'm sure.  He's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God!	Hang on!
<EOC>	<EOC>

Are you sure?	Are you a believer, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, Ma, no wires.	You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?	Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.	Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

Mom's going to hate it.	Always on my ass, anyway.
Like you don't give her a hard time.	Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you take that damn thing off the table.	You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

<EOC>	<EOC>
See you made it.	Yeah.
You don't look half-bad.	You either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how about a little one-on-one?	What are we playing for?
Clothes.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me the ball.	My court, I go first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that?	Nobody.

We're going to take you home.	That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're here on the sofa bed...	Charlie...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel?	Pretty strange.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry Charlie.	Save it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.	I have to talk to you..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.	Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom!	The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you get that, dear?	Sure, Mom.  Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?	For what?
Maddy's party.	I don't feel very festive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not the maid!	Way to go, Mom!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I remember that dress.	Rosalie Testa!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	You alright?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.	He pissed me off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's getting pretty late. We better go.	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can he not have a heartbeat?	Maybe it takes a while...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's weird...	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was the file name?	K-R-O-one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why, Beckett?	Because they deserve to, Walter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you giving an exam?	I said, don't worry about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know that, Charles.	More than your friend. Family.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Innocuous?	Defined by Webster's as harmless.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?	I have AIDS.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who'd you get?	What?
Find a lawyer?	I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.	What's her name?
Rayisha.	Rayisha. Very nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...	I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?	Yes.
Were you recently promoted?	Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have a problem with gays, Joe.	Not especially.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?	My lettuce is wilting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me that was you.	Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?	Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see? Riddick?	Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many you see?	One or two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!	We can't make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ, you don't know what's out there!	I know what's in here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.	Probably right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Better keep moving....	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""God is Great,"" yes?"	I'm born-again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.	Please...this solves nothing...please....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very big beads.	Not staying in here another....
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.	No. She's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Zaius --	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, just a minute --	Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Landon! Send a last signal.	What signal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we take a dip?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	A man, Dr. Maximus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sustained.	Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's him...Landon.	Which one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.	Taylor, you can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's moving his fingers!	Of course. He saw you moving yours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's he from?	Barnes comes from Hell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Taylor! Francis!	Over here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Taylor, you okay man?	Yeah. How 'bout you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel good?	Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.	Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The brush-off, huh?	I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They might think I was running away from something.	Possibly, Miss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dance?	No thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.	I'd rather wait until it does matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?	Nothing matters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	You leave it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What this?	Yes.
Where's you get it?	A graduation present.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
In case you want to have us followed.	I don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?	I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Recently, then.	No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not too hard, is it?	Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scotch and plain water, I think.	Warm water, no doubt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No doubt about that one.	How about Magruder?
He checks too.	That leaves two strangers.
So far.	Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?	She might.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Sit on that log, dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now first of all, tell us your name.	Penfield.  James Penfield.
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.	No jokes.  James is in love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta be fucking crazy.	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three seconds... two... one...	SHIT!!

Wild ride, huh?	Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
<EOC>	<EOC>

The hell are they?!	They took a left at the next light!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know where they're going.	Figured you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's goin' on?	Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those are cold.	Warm them up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?	No way, old buddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.	There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?	I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you going after next, sir?	Who indeed...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... I would take advantage of it.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ugly habit, biting your nails.	You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three hundred.	Fine.
What's your name, lover.	Edward.  My name is Edward.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get in.  This side.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a very good year.	Oooh, thank god.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'd cost you.	Of course.  How much?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about dinner?	Dinner can wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.	I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?	I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.	Afternoon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?	Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a pair of boots?	Do I!?  Momma!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Having a good time, Vivian?	Yeah.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every ship but the four you sent.	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... as ... you ... wish...	Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.	As you wish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No more rhymes now, I mean it.	Anybody want a peanut?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	It's you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Fezzik, please --	Everybody ... MOVE!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.	Right, right, sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll wait until you're ready.	Again. Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?!	No one of consequence.
I must know.	Get used to disappointment.

<EOC>	<EOC>
She stole some money.	A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.	And the police haven't been able to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.	Los Angeles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute!	Now what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My mother is not dead!	I didn't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They thought she'd be coming to me.	Left Phoenix under her own steam?
<EOC>	<EOC>
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?	Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The child!	Yes.
There's no child here.	But ... the dogs...

<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I could go out of town.

Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?	Well, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.	Yeah, he's still up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.	I think Daddy suspects.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Took your time gettin' here.	She has other things to do, Dave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter with him?	I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Ma'am.	Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's sick.	Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.	You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the... ?!  What was that for?	Follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pure horse.	You are such a disappointment, Benny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna get beside him.	No you're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any preferences?	Whatever goes bang.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see that?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why you - what have you done with Janet?	Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm coming with you.	There's no point both of us getting wet.

I'm sorry.  I'm just --	Stressed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyway, Victoria's nice.	Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take a drink. Calm down!	I say we gotta take action. Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How goes it?	It never ends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going?	Got to talk to the brothers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your mama?	She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.	Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	I just can't. Okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh shit	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How the hell did we get this detail?	Guess it's our turn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
By not disgracing her memory!	What does that mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't understand.	Understand what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now get talkin'	I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Danny, I'm touched.	Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? Is it bad?	I'm afraid so, Danny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?	They have. But they never found a lab.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You, madam, are a heartless wench.	And you've got wiener breath.
Really?	It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My sentiments exactly.	Why are you doing this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Bubba?	Maybe he isn't showing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Find a chaplain.	...alright, let me know when.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck, John.	Thank you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, where are you from?	You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.	Figured.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, that's Ryan.	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No kiddin'?	What deal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	In the shadow by those two trees.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not yet.	Keep trying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.	You don't count.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?	It doesn't take this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, can I ask you a question?	Sure, Reiben.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.	HERE THEY COME!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir.	Alright, come with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think he really believed it?	Who knows?  It worked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How fast?	Twenty-four-five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're tough, J-man.	He's a mess!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, don't go in there.	Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then what's love?	I'm gonna call her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does it say?	Read it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.	Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lloyd, it's us.	Look at his face, he did the deed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank-you.  The real world.	Look at those eyes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He does this every year?	It's the worst job since keymaster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Or, or I could always wear this one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice one.	Yeah?
I think you should wear that.	You think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ooop, excuse me.	How you doin', brother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you man	I love you too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want these people.	These people, my people, I want my people.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I got for you?	Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good.  How's it going?	Things are great, things are great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?	Wine?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll talk to him.	I think it's too late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four hundred, four fifty -	More.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's very generous of you.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need to talk.	Stern.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...	Stop it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.	Its over, Cotton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you put up with this Greek shit?	Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Good question. You took the bait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	That's not the way we play the game.
I don't play games.	What if your life depended on it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh--a God complex	Stay away from the cop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got a surprise for you.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Gale?
She's not here right now.	But she's standing right next to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.  Hello?	Hello.
Who is this?	Who is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.	She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jennifer needs me.	Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.	Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
<EOC>	<EOC>
OH. OH GOD. GALE --	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you excuse me for a moment?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't kill anybody.	No one's saying you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Owwww...	You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ready to party hard tonight?	You know it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Yeah...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought she was dead.	She looked dead. Still does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She can't get both of us.	Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Billy? What the...	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?	You sleep in THAT?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were...	I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Why don't you want to talk to me?
Who is this?	You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
I don't think so.	What's that noise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Popcorn.	You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.	I only eat popcorn at the movies.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.	Really? What?
Just some scary movie.	Do you like scary movies?
Uh-huh.	What's your favorite scary movie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want to know my name?	Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm two seconds from calling the police.	They'd never make it in time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Michael... Michael Myers.	YES!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now for the real question.	NOOOO....
But you're doing so well.	Please go away! Leave us alone!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You girls ready.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please. You owe me.	I owe you shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.	You got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you believe this shit?	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.	Just like old times, ain't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not necessary.  You're in.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time is it?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't know.	NO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who said this was murder?	No one yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a bucket of vomit.	Is there any blood in it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You go to movies at least?	I read.  Remember reading?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No fingerprints?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There must be something.	We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would we?	Satisfy our curiosity?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is Victor.	Call an ambulance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You knew I'd say yes.	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything... anything missing or different.	I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?	I can't do this now... please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This painting...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have you lived here?	Too long.  What do you think so far?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's California?	How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...	That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get along...	Why don't you finish the job?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you saw wasn't Lucy.	It was, I tell you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...	Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.	Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What in...?	Captain Clayton...Captain!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you want me to call you?	Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?	Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Futterman?	He just couldn't wait...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...	Scar?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...She's not...	I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on! Get out of here while you can...	Over there!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.	I got your boy killed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not a little girl any more.	You've seen her!...She's alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why else?	Come on, say it.  You know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Making our very own solstice fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?	I just had a really strange experience.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, did you sleep good?	Yeah... I have to go to town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you get me out of there?	I wouldn't have made it by myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, my lady!	Lady?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.	Yes, I saw it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	To my weekly confession.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cut round him for now.	What? Who?
Romeo.	The one who came with your letter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are lost.	No, it will turn out well.
How will it?	I don't know, it's a mystery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
God bless you!	Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do not know how to undress a man.	It is strange to me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will! What--?	A literary feud. Quite normal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My lady Viola.	My lord.
I have spoken with your father.	So my lord? I speak with him every day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Think about it.
No.	Come on, David.
No.	Juliet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's still here.	He couldn't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?	You call them if you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, can't think of anything else that matters.	About the mail --
It's very kind of you to offer, but --	Where do you think you'll go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you know --	Just serve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aroused and inflamed.	Alex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not usually drunk.	Not usually this drunk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder how he did it?	Did what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you calm down.	Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Interesting.	I see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I've never seen them.	You're sure of that.
Yes.	That wasn't a question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Expecting anyone?	What?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?	No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?	No one. I promise.
Who have you talked to?	No one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you'd gone to work.	With a face like this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We already know. All about it.	It was on the television.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So let's go.	You and me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyway, you remember Harold?	Yeah, baby, how's it going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is she all right?	I don't know. Just a minute...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comb my hair out later, honey.	No, that's okay, I'll do It now.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why not?	... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And?	And what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'll ruin everything.	I know... you don't know, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit down.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- you are.	Fuckin' A --
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- gee...	-- what?
I don't know what gets into me.	You were great.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.	No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.	You were great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you want to go?	Sammy's?
He still having parties?	He never stopped.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?	No, man.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me!	I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George --	Keep moving --
Now, George --	Nobody's gonna get you but me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will we live together?	We live together now.
But in the same house, you know, one house.	-- Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jill, say hello to Felicia.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Go where?	Egypt!
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?	Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, Jackie --	-- she's a very compulsive girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come you took your own car?	I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.	What is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You did fuck him, didn't you?	I'm very tired, George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?	Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's an unusual trade.	Yes it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But the important thing is you're successful at it.	In a way. But...
But what?	I'm better than the guy I work for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, honey, I...	That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Awww --	I'll call you back.
Come on by.	I'll call you back...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, doll, what's wrong?	You know what's wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.	Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?	You're going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No of course not.	-- we're going to be here all night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  I'm just a little tired.	Then why don't you go to sleep?
I can't.  I have too much to do.	Dad?
Yes?	Do you like this hotel?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?	French Fries and Ketchup.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Danny?	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red Rum.	Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Red Rum.	Are you having a bad dream?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy...	Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!	Danny!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy!	Oh!

Grady?	Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.	That's right, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.	What time is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I...	I can't really remember.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course I am.	Of course you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay away from me!  Please...	Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.	Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!	Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!	Give me the bat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wendy...	Go away.
Give me the bat.	Go away.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Lowe's car-?	Blue. This blue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. Go away.	Let me help you up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But how?	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
I think I hear it!	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you doing.	Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.	I love my heddles.  Show me again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry, Sister!	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Soprano or alto?	Whatever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence, are you with us?	Um, I don't really know this one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamn it!	Mary Clarence!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And if I don't?	Then-you run.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're looking for Mike.	You found him -- but we're not open yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't see anything in here!	Willy -- hit the lights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peace on Earth.	However, we can also pray for other things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not like other guys.	He's decent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd rather sing than do anything!	It's better than ice cream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean -- they kidnapped her?	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?	A Benedictine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They spend two days in chains.	Two days... ?  For murder?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He is a behemoth.	A diseased monster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going?	Up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's spectacular.	Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
No, I couldn't...	I have others.  All I need is this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Listen.
I hear nothing.	No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?	I doubt that's the end.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hit ain't got no gas in it.	See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure, I guess.	Don't rush ever'body, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I guess.	Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.	Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?	Tolerable, I reckon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?	Huh?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?	Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?	Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, kid.	Wow. They sure did a job on you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	You don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Question withdrawn, you may step down.	You're implying th...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cigarette?	I'll take two.  One for later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't let go, you s...	It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...	That's all he said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which of you dolls is Daphne?	Bull fiddle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?	It's private.  Go away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nellie told us about it.	We're not too late, are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Daphne.	Good night, Josephine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's some nerve!	Daphne got a proposal tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
OH!	Terribly sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	I'm fine.
How's the bottle?	Half-full.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And bring the cocktail shaker.	Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was it.	What's the big idea?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a moment, miss -  May I?	Help yourself.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.	I am Cinderella the Second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.	Goodbye?
This is where I get off.	Oh, you don't get off that easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daphne...	Yes, Osgood?

That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!	But there was a lot of firing earlier...

<EOC>	<EOC>
Programming ready?	Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
<EOC>	<EOC>

<U>Computer off</U>!	It's taken control of the computer...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...	Opinion, Mister. Spock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.	Aye, sir.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid she's going to walk.	And I'm supposed to care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Machines do not EAT message.	Look, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, I'm undeserving.	Ironic, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So I have to tell you something in confidence...	You're a cross-dresser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you said...?	Beats me.  Ask your mom.

Tim, what are you talking about?	Ask your girlfriend.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please?	Look, look, just get off my property.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do your covers and all that shit.	'Bye, Jeff.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, where's Erica?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.	Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, my mom has this saying.	Yeah?
"""Don't write any checks you can't cash."""	Really? What else does your mother say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""See what's around you listen to their lies"""	So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seriously? It's a great idea.	Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.	Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Fucking drunk, huh?	You have the largest penis. Can we go please?

You're really going to send it to De Mille?	This is the right day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A Storm Dragon?	No, a super girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I'd better keep it.	Whatever you say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All this talk about love, it's silly.	You don't like me? You hate me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this how?	Terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Before you go...	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! Ethan!	Hmmm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finished your estimate?	Well, there's several ways to go .
<EOC>	<EOC>
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.	I'll drink to that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you making:	It's going to be a tree, I think.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can do that.	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you do that?	Must've been a defective puck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your hair looks the same.	It was just a trim.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lucy; come back!	Somebody's gotta do something!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you believe in knocking?	Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can I do for you?	I'm Linda Lee.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?	Nope.  Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Gee, I always loved porch swings.	Me too. That's why I put this one up.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's the other woman?	That's his sister. Vera Webster.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What terrific story?	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't see anything.	Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?	Where do you usually find a light switch?

Oh, Superman!	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
<EOC>	<EOC>

Bet he makes it.	You're on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...	Otis...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that real enough for you?	It is for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you been waiting long?	A while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?	I object to that form of question. Note that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.	You've been retained?
Yes.	Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.	We're on our way there now...

Not lately.  Did you check messages?	I thought you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you say?	I didn't say anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.	What... what do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get us out of here...	Nicholas...

I've been so lonely.	I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.	Don't take another step.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How concerned should I be?	It was a misunderstanding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...	Attempted murder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?	I did okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Luke, can I talk to you?	Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And those are Luke's and mine.	There's a carriage house around back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hmm.	I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jeez.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it over?	No, it's getting worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Had a feeling it was you.	You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.	Not her brand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.	Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
...We goin'?	Huh? No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello!	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.	I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.	Anything missin'?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The body?	What's left of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Margo, these aren't seed pods.	What are they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?	Don't stop now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not supposed to go back there.	Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut them up!	Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop!	Holy mother, what is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Argo!  Hobbes!	Get back!  Now!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of egg is it?	It's reptilian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it doing?	It's scared of me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help someone!	Oh God!  Help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not watching the sea.	Why would we--
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was hoping we could have a special evening.	I won't be late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you doing down here?	Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I know.	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you want?	I made macaroni.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Truman, I took the ""hypocrite"" oath!"	I bet you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you live around here?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got something to show me.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You looking for him for some other reason?	Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that?	Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scully...	Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?	I'm in the vending room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you drunk, Mulder?	I was until about an hour ago.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hear that?	I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd they go?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to keep moving.	Where are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Mulder.	What happened to Kurtzweil?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Scully?	I have answers for you.
Is she alive?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me out. Stop the car.	Driver.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hates me.	Lucien Baines?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait...	"Like hell ""wait."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
That went well.	Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?	They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Into Stargher.  Inside...	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need it.	Now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Den leuten.	Ja, ja, ja.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?	Just another part I've got to learn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Harry's place, isn't it?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wer ist da?	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going back home.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...again.	There isn't enough for two laughs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know this man?	I have never seen him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joseph Harbin...	No.
He works in a military hospital.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.	I don't want it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A parrot bit me.	Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.	Oh, Mr. Martins...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zane Grey.	Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very popular, sir.	Very popular. Are you staying long?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hmm.	She's been arrested.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...this way.	What do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.	Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Find out?	Hear the details.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Speak English?	English?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you know Mr. Lime well?	Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...	Yes, yes, I remember you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's all you meant?	What else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?	He didn't want to get involved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Joseph Harbin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Martins...	Not when I get interested.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I make it all fact?	Why no, Mr. Martins.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.	She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.	We moved rooms because of him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.	Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone ok?	We're ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Richard - I saw a fin!	What!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi there. Here, take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fucking Danny, man...	He's an asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.	Then I won't bring you....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nazis talk about it all the time.	Do they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a much easier game.	Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More cultural than political.	Obviously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one were you aiming at?	The mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Drake, did he ever show up?	No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When do you want it to go off?	Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --	Shut up...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who'd you kill?	Four. But no one this important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam Sandler.	Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.	He was funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tell you she's mine!	Hello!
You know each other?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You forgot the Hula!	Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Enzo, wake up!	Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get that?	"""That""!  This is not a ""that""..."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jacques, my friend, how are you?	Enzo...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	... For the mermaids.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here...  Here...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I recognize you.	We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?	No... in the hut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.	Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?	Only to help the medics, I assure you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?	Uh... Yes, of course!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.	That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.	Again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you said he was Peruvian?	Haven't you been listening?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who... Who is that?	Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.	What's up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry. I'm better with men.	Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Esther!	Mordechai!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Esther!	Mordechai!

Mmmyes.	Nice fellow?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure!	No. I'm serious about this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.	Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I'd best be off.	I want to ask you something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.	Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.	When will they be back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...	The dead can wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?	Im fine standing, thank you.
