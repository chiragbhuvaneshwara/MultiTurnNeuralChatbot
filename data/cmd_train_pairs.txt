<EOC>	<EOC>
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.	Fine. Show me the body.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.	He got off on six.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How came you by this blade?	I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's your ticket, ma'am.	Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.

"Say the words, ""I understand."""	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's right. They'll string her up.	Do you want to come to Argo City?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you drop any sail?	Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?	My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?	Fifteen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madam...?	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's continue.	"You had one guy ""like that?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>

She's hotter'n a heifer.	Fan-belt's shot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --	And we can watch ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was trying to tell me something.	"And his message was  ""Together, no matter what?"""

Oveur.	Dunn.

That's where he'll be.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It smells damp.	It's just been empty a while.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's gone now.	Oh, Jesse...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me get that for you.	Oh please. I can't have you do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to get in trouble.	Don't worry it's okay!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it - What's wrong?	Whoa!
What is it?	I don't know - a sharp pain.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I trust it's your size.	It's---beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you two cut it out?	This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?	I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ground defense.	Did you hear that?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Chance to get even?	I'll spot you five points.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How am I gonna do that?	Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The wind --	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Otho, that's terrible.	My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't.	Come on.
My medication.  I left it back there.	We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're ready for you, sir.	Showtime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did their son see it happen?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up an' at 'em, Taber.	What's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you...	Shhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's waitin' for you in the card room.	Let him wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twelve years.	How did you get together?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	When's your birthday?
<EOC>	<EOC>
About anybody but yourself. You never have.	And you're a little fucking reject.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Oh.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, Billy.	Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?	"""Can't"" should never be in a man's vocabulary."
Why not?	Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barnett?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't danced in.....	In ages, I know, me neither.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... And what do you call these?	Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be okay.	You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I won't let anyone hurt you.	Watch it. They're coming out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meet Irene.	Hi.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I scoured the city for it.	I love it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What shall we drink to, sir?	To peace on earth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up and down, up and down!	I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.	What's wrong with it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!	Orson, please ... it's too bright
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I'm calling her!
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- and take this with you.	Where did this come from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's unique?	Not what.  Who.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you step out of the car, son?	I don't understand what the--
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.	Sure, Sheriff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not going to hold your weight.	Just stay there, Nell!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see, Erik?	I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?	It is day, of course, Freya.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're not Cong.	We're Americans.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm just going to my room.	You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.	And who is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Melanie.	You're late for breakfast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You ride Winston.	You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.	What does that mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that all?	Just remember, I'll be watching.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been a good worker --	Don't do this, Don.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy!	Yes, Amy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.	Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.	Sure.
I'll be down in a minute	O.K.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're gonna be what?	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.	All I meant was -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.	Oh, yeah -- right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?	That what they call you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...	I love you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I'm not.	Then you'll call, right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.	Come in, children.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know now.	Know what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't a very good place to talk.	I don't want to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You told them, didn't you?	Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if you hide me?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.	For what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear what I said?	I want to document my trip to America.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta be going.	Going to Turley, was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think I'm uncomfortable...	Correct.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd given you up.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't forget your identity.	See you next week.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Passport, please.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That bastard.	George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forty-four.  Forty-five.	I'd say you've got about two minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?	Hilarious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.	The Sera monks have surrendered?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Fezzik?	I thought he was with you.
No.	In that case --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never saw one that big.	What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you here?	Am I not welcome?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The James-Younger Gang.	Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if I did?	You'd know I wouldn't run off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill Styles...	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep what handy?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with you?	You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why? He can't help us.	He's probably the only one who can help us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ray, run faster.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you, Warren.	Huh...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?	Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will the Senator yield for a question?	I yield.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill!	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They did show up.  Isn't that great?	I hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But there's still daylight left.	'Bout two hours left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.	Right. Just a sec.
Okay.	Okay, come on down.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Right here?	Raise the platform, hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say?	Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the rush, John Henry?	I ain't John Henry.
Good.	What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It sure is good to be home....	It sure is....
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to put it here?	Use your fucking instinct.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is miraculous.	Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you pay Nilsen?	Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Systems register functional.	All systems are working, Commander.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tubbs, it's me.	Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...	Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?

You're sure it's okay?	Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...	Let me see what I can do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone should rob the office.	Huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Get going!

Which couch?	That one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
D'Artagnan!	Athos, my friend!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme put some clothes on.	No time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...	Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
And it's good!	I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.	...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom?	Yeah?
You gonna stay out here?	For a while.

No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"""	"""What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>

You okay?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think I like this.	You're not supposed to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.	Who else could have used that key?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks open on the other side.	Don't know what's behind it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ.	I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have no luggage.	The gentleman has nothing contraband.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... that's my business, madame.	That's no business... that's a social injustice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lois, I usually do.	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you in hell, Snake.	If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Imzadi. This is so good.	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?	Worse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's you friend?	He's not coming...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.	What's that then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm with you kid.	Where is he?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.	No, you're dead! You're all dead!

What's wrong?	Nothing. Buckle up, okay?

I'm not interested --	I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.	I knew you'd say that, too --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were late.	I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?	You want to go talk to him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.	Mr. Brady's a cop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now.  You were saying?	But -- what is he doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A whole lot of nothing.	So where do we start?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should be sleeping, baby.	I'm trying, mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey now... what the fuck... ?	Again.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I made her nervous.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Jones.	Lao She.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know a secret.	What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.	Who told you that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!	My name is Louis Peluso.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dock control reports ready, sir.	Helm ready, sir.

Are you okay?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.	And?
And I--we--want some Black people up.	Did you ask Sal?

Looking good...	You should talk...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You get mugged or something?	Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smith, get out of there...	Come again, Skipper?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my goodness... Bobby...	Hi, Tita.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know where he is.	Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.	Probably.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And then what happened?	We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.	I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.	Fletch, I got nervous. Please....

Miss Henried, I think you better...	...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
FUCK YOU!	GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said you wouldn't laugh!	It's not you - it's the dress!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You son of a bitch! You conned me!	You're gonna laugh.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the plan?	Plan?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Victoria.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were never invited to my house.	You're looking for a urine sample.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a hit?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.	But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.	And now you tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, I couldn't hear you?	You went out this morning and bought a gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.	I want to talk about the baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is the flight full?	I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then we're all in on it?	Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.	It's so cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kay.	Yes, Michael.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?	"I haven't heard an official ""no"" yet."
You haven't told then, huh?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the --!	Ben.  Are you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think that's the place she's buried?	If they actually bothered to bury her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you do?	"I said ""Sorry, wrong room"" and walked away."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carlos had some great rock.	I bet.  That was our rent!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is.  We have to pull the plug.	You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought there were people here....	I'll go look....
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about some evening clothes?	I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.	Tails.  That's ridiculous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what did you do?	I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	The wound is bleeding!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
She's got guards with her.	What guy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll miss you, Mike.	Listen, I'll... see you again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?	Hauser left me a note.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.	Not any more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
MMMmm!	Is it that music?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!	Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
CARTMAN!	WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	AH UGH.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beat it.	No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?	No thanks.
Ah, come on.	I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And then we run out of food and oxygen.	The water will still recycle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're surrendering.	Yes, sir.
What unit?	First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	You don't remember anything else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.	That so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you don't know nothing about this?	'Fraid not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Biology, mostly.	Why?
I... I don't know...	What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No no no no no no no no no...	Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not bad, for a hooker.	I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you need anything, just...	Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay...see you soon.	...and thanks for the flowers.
What flowers?	The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Gimme this god-...	...-damn phone.
Talk to me.	INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.	C'mon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On top of the peak.	It looks like a winding route.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where what?	Where would you go to sell a chip?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now that don't make much sense.	No. It just made them feel better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.	You ever played billiards before?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think it's contaminated.	You don't even know what that word means.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brand new.	This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're all part of Satan's army now!	What the hell is going on?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like coffee.	It'll warm you up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.	What...?
She owes me a meal.	I'd stay away from her, Miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, he's not sore, is he?	He'll come around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Woody?!	We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it like?	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with him?	He's still working out some identity issues.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.	Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Has he sent the challenge yet?	Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.	I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?	You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.	It's a free country, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it...	Looks simple to operate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
These for me?	If you like.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do?	Follow her.
On what?	Run, stupid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?	Um, well...
Are you lying to me?	Well...
What did we say about lying?	I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?	I said I'm not lying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a hand?	I want amphetamines.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hostile and uncooperative.	Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her husband left her	Oh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.	Aside from the obvious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
What's that?	A present I picked up for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.	You1re leaving, too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd it go?	Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Then you can go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, can I come in?	Yeah, hurry up though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.	To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.	Why would you be there?

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm ready when you are.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will we be in this war?	No. This war is almost over.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hishradyo.	Max - where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's...pretty fast.	You're out of shape.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And we're looking after him, are we?	I'll look after meself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you... remember me?	I've seen you before.  Your picture...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is either crazy, or brilliant.	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Arrah!	Oh, my God!
What do I do?	I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?	Put some butter on it--or ice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you cry when your father died?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She adores you.	She thinks I can bring Edward back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The gang's all here!	Keep 'em busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's part of growing up, honey.	What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?

Just now... I went with Seymour.	You cunt!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we go to my office?	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.	Ask me a question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter with you?	Nothing.
Why the bad temper?	It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it dead?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry about that.	Okay -- up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't forget about production for use.	I won't, Earl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll let you know tomorrow.	Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Congratulations.	Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.	Who?

<EOC>	<EOC>
You remember your dreams, Grady?	Only the wet ones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does that mean?	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
But an Oracle can.	That's different.

Mr. Galvin's...	Let me talk to Mickey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard what happened.	Were the flags for Teddy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd better collect my family first.	Oh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.	The best defense is offense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Huh?	IÂ’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean by that?	Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?	Sort of... Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you looking for now?	Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.	What's it to ya?
You must have a girlfriend.	That's none of your business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... I don't know...	What don't you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?	Gimme that Phillips right there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
NOVA!!	Stifler!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Asshole!!	Where did you learn that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What if every country legalized at the same time?	Somehow, I don't see that happening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Diz...	What ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is everybody?	Well - it's cold, Margie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?	Been where?
To Old Madrid.	Never even been to New Madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?	Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Slam it?	Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it?	That's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Under the Bleachers""... by Seymour Butts."	Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's just insecurity.	I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.	What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.	About what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he going to be okay?	I hope so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?	Supergirl?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about transportation?	You can use my car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?	Should we?
In case we want to switch nights.	I suppose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Robert, do you mind?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But he always says...	... whatever is manly and independent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the microwave.	Make anyone cry today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch out!!	Keep firing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
His name was Jimmy.	What happened?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.	Who did he go to meet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?	We didn't get that far.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well where is she?!	Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell him I'm not here.	I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I scored a goal!	That's great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready, Ma?	I'll get Rosasharn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.	I know, we'll be there soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You alright?	Kristen...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was quick.	False alarm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.	I know, but that's what you like about me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of what?	God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw... but...	But nothing... you do live here don't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're all gone--or dead.	They never wrote you nothing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Having romance problems, Romeo?	Not with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex... people are staring.	Let them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's about the Florida job.	The Florida job?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whew! Hiya, boys!	Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So this is what, a test?	Call it a reckoning of character.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He won't go into the interrogation room.	Someplace else, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go, for Christsakes...	It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellie...	I'm all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, here are fifty francs.	Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.	Naturally, Comrade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are having a mid-life crisis.	I know, it's stupid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Could we have intercourse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.	Has a lot of rain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!	Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what's wrong?	Nothing wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look what you made me do!	What's wrong with you?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah... no.	Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not here, Caesar.	Where, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you don't mind?	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now go find me a big stick.	In the desert? What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful....	Anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I see him?	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing for lunch?	Right now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meteorites!	Bingo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.	All the insides are gone!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing really worthwhile.	That's what I thought.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call Dad!	On it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dodge.  Dodge.	What?
Get up.	Yeah, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He... he loved me.	Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!	I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.	I want him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You hungry?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let it go, Captain.	Goddamned small town bullshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?	Was I?
Yes.	No.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?	No.
You have nothing to hide.	When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?	No, who?
Thieves.	Why?
They're inured to it.	You think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Got to be somewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All he wanted was some mu-shu.	Are you okay, Lee?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yessir. I'm sorry.	Why is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like rotting meat.	You're not rotting meat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.	What happened? Oh my God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How the heck?!...	What's going on?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.	What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
You.	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Like ""Thou shall not kill""?"	Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?	I don't know.  That's the point.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?	Get out of my facial.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But...	But what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will we do?	'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?	It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?	Yes, that's why I said it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop--stop right here.	What? What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sean!   Catch the rope!	The rope!  The rope!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kind of isolated.	Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, the sky is blue...	The sun! That's it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?	No.  The Righteous Brothers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?  That noise?	What noise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.	I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.	Where am I?
Jabba's palace.	Who are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One of us?	Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That ain't funny.	DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weir.	He's dead...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you see?	Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.	You really don't remember anything that happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You make me feel...	Loved?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.	Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.	Your back? Did you fall?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must be nice.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look after him.	But...
Do I have to raise me voice?	Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...	No...
You don't take orders very well, do you?	I don't take orders at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're still dressed?	Well, I want to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now left and that's it in front of you.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	No, no.  When are you going home?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And if we have to go to Siberia...	I'll send you a muff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jabez -- help!	Coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A marker's like a check, Harry.	I know what a marker is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got that?	No, I don't get that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...	... you want a menage on your wedding night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're evil.	Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you're not as we imagined you.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.	Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.	Right, seriously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want from us?	Just listen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Max.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting experience.	You watch yourself!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cameron, I'm a little busy	It's off. The whole thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...?	Tell me why I miss him.
He's dead?	That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How should I...?	Tell me why he's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you?	Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will the Senator yield?	Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	It's alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Out with Belinda?	That's over. Way over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go for it.	Hold my keys, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me, too.  You think they're in there?	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Purpose of visit?	A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
You're late.	Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?	Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you think you should put them in water?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.	Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.	You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.	I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it's been awhile.	Barks and growls at his boss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think you can bargain with me?!	Take the money and walk away!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carmine left?	He's gone?
He's not here?	Carmine's gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.	The socks?  It's cold in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck.	Thanks again for your help!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll stay.	Get in the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is no performance.	And no one knows but us...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You little bitch!	Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gate three. It's boarding now.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Making sure nobody's following us.	That would be inconceivable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any brothers?	No, no brothers, no sisters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?!	Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.	Yeah? You sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need more light on that, Four.	Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!	Yes, Miss Ratched...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Haven't we met before?	None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.	Out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And more.	Why didn't you stop me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was your date?	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Vivian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!	I know, be still.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.	So, what? Eleven?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes; John's bad.	Tell me another secret about my Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop that!	You'll never get away from me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.	Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
<EOC>	<EOC>
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.	Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was fixing to betray us!	You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!	That don't make no sense!
<EOC>	<EOC>
To us!	Whatever our name is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All you all right?	I'm fine....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.	Perhaps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --	You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!	Then your father's a wimp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can handle it.	I know you can.  But I'd like to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's Brad?	A wreck.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?	Fools!
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.	Time to check with Flavors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Walter...	What are you doing here so early?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, everybody!	All in . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take your luggage back, baas.	No, no -- just a moment, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?	Taking you for granite?
<EOC>	<EOC>
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!	Why isn't he MOVING??
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to stay.	No! Sit down now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Mom -- keep it on!	Okay ... But just for tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Faux goose down.	Still...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?	Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.	This could be it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are the disks still in your room?	No!  They're right here --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, just a minuteÂ—you can'tÂ—	Shut up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't started in on the internal organs?	Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Married?	Happily.
... Kids?	Three. You? Married?
No.	I didn't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.	Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on Terrance?	Canada is saving us!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Bud, no... not you.	Who then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do?	Can't complain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who're these guys?	Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my dear God...	He was dead.  He had to be dead...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't know that it does.	Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Introduce yourselves.	I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aramis... These are... these are whores!	So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?	My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So?	I don't know Brady.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?	The ad..
<EOC>	<EOC>
How far are we from Mexico?	About two hundred and fifty miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You do know how to do that, don't you?	Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?	Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...	Guess you gotta go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wants one.	Dead or alive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can do it.	Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.	You believe that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're crazy -- !	I saw it -- !
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!!	You threw it at me!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you Janey.	It was lovely!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aw, please Junebug?	No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to get him to the infirmary.	What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.	I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Why so coy about the word ""frozen""?"	Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?	Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..

<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't, sir -- Nothing!	Out of control, and blind as a bat!

This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!	Hang in there, I'll think of something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't you have no inkling?	Yes; from the first night.
The first night?	Our honeymoon.
How's that?	She turned me out of the bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we shouldn't.	What?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to?	Want to what?
Kiss me.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, Ninotchka?	It's from Paris.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.	It'll wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.	Whose footprints?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, guys.	Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.	That's good, honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know how else to look--	You're a stuttering Stanley!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Quiet, Mollie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just something I'm trying.	No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God!  He's so excessive!	Where have you been?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.	On my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I Â– Mr. Lipnik Â–	KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me, darling.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was the job for?	Who do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was fiction, of course.	Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.	No. It most certainly was not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still loves you though.	In a depressingly asexual way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lookit Kip. All grown up...	Hey, Donny --
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I ain't got you...	But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...	No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...	I said, I ain't got you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.	Abdul-Shabazz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.	Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cotter?	I'm not finished.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not true.	There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, if you want my opinion...	I don't. I have my own.
You grown.	Yes sir
Well, good luck with the job.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what do you need, Fergus?	Need to go across the water.
Do you now.	Need to lose myself awhile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeeeess!!!	Maybe this can wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't see!  How can I fight?	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...who root through...uh...presents, and...	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No police.	But, Senor--
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.	Senor, you need a doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we should do some exercise.	This is all the exercise I need...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never forgot that.	It's two weeks.
Almost three.	That is so romantic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything special about the case?	When she...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.	What'll I tell the kids?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	Will you make love with me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, there.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something wrong with you Marvosa?	It's just...catching up with me, you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think we can turn it on?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.	Don't cry, Bubba.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have I done?	You have fed. You were made for this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...	No -- no, I'm don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemon?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...	I'm sending you back to Hell!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name?	Claire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?	Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.	Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready for another?	No, I'm okay for now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we getting married tomorrow?	No.
The day after tomorrow?	Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you stand on all this?	On all what?
On FurtwÃ¤ngler.	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut up, Tommy!	Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could have stopped him.	Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
So you all make the same mistakes?	Gives us something in common.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're ready for the real thing?	At this point I'm ready for anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what she asked me?	I don't care what she asked you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This spells trouble.	I have a guest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoo-hoo!	Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?	Yeah.  Drowning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean?	He means they're thieving dogs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a redhead.	I know.
"Anybody ever call you ""Red""?"	Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why not?	Just don't... I've got a headache.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you doing through there?	It looks like a bomb's dropped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.	How'd I know it was for you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is wrong, my darling?	Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, enough of this shit.	Alright, asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me get him to the boat.	Leave him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know...	Come on, you can make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I one... or many?	The librarian... or the library...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you see?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I'll just keep working.	What're you crazy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?	You're the best, Maxie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beer okay?	Yeah, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ach so!	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think he's been fired.	It doesn't say th...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.	For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to your hand?	A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?	Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When they realise IÂ’m missing...	Shut up and walk...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are we going here? I hate this place.	It'll only take a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone aboard young Bill?	Yes, Sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's idea was it?	Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't do that.	The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could we go somewhere?	I'm heading out of town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get it?	Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're crying. Why?	I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sean.  Sean, where are you?	Someone's looking for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know what it is to be sorry.	Steve --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here.	What are they...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It can't take that long.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't care for him.	He's your brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She likes you.	Definitely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's over, Hunter.	Boy, that's terrific.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there something about the house?	Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's all the panic about?	The Dragon...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Funny, huh?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not just after this girl, are you?	Who, me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't know you had a secret admire.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you don't get shit out of it.	Have you ever swallowed it before?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's odd.	He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe it's the same horse.	We still have a way to go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck are you talking about?!	Nobody's fucking anybody!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold it...!	I'll prove it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That coward. Son of a bitch.	Maybe he just went to the store.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.	Indeed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"With an ""o"".  Harold with an ""o""."	What -- you want me to retype it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah-ah-ah!	Mother!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Physician, heal thyself.	That's all you have to say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to read it?	No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--	--No, have you had any experience with that?
Yes.	It sure ain't good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You looked beautiful last night, you know.	So did you
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I ask you something?	Go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?	Ready, Major.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where did you get that?	At the newsstand on 3rd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not gonna die.	I know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ever met Walter Winchell?	No, when I was but a tender lad--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...	Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.	Yes, sir.  Is that all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now?	We wait -- with our mouths shut.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a...jerk!	Peter, are you okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He doesn't wait for an answer.	Who says it's a he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks.	You doing a story on this guy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what I think?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll share something with you.	I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't I?	Uh.  You hate my guts?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have it?	Yeah. It's right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Machismo?	Somebody find him a knife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How big a package we talking about?	This by this...
Dope?	Not in that company.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiya, Doc.	Martin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here, where've you been?	I have a new client.
That crazy guy?	Yes. Joe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm coming.	No. I just gotta go find him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She say where he is?	I don't think she knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Ok.	Do you want I send it to your room?
Great.	Thank you, Mr. Harris.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!	The elevators are still runnin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Word of God...	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!	DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?	How about I go right, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Frank D'Angelo around?	At the bar - Sidney...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody move.	But she's --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	I thought you had Play Practice.
"Don't look good for ""Trial of the Heart."""	Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	Yeah.
Why're you crying?	I'm not crying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""A mule is an animal with long funny ears."""	"""He kicks up at anything he hears."
<EOC>	<EOC>
No... The General is right.	MOM!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, your psychotic is here.	Not today...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're drunk.	You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Here, how's this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rose, get in the boat!	Goodbye, mother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing here?	Let's go down to the basement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.	That's okay, I wanted to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder if you might give me a ride.	Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?	We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we get out of here?	Sure.  Where to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	When we know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, George . . .	Hello, Violet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got salt last week.	Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll find the evidence.	You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think I must?	You decide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, hey, hey!	Surprised?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit.	We got it. We got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well.  That was brilliant.	Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are leaving.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One SIXTH the speed of sound!	Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?	F-14's sir.
Tomcats?	Yes sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
If I'm ever in New York...	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we allowed to park here?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.	Bye, Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lemme take you home.	I'll get my jacket.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to see you, Terry.	You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.	What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.	Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.	Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.	You go to hell.
What did you say?	You go toÂ—
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock, that was actually funny.	We DO sleep lying down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?	Easy, guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Almost five!	I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you taking me?	Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay ?	Ow...

Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?	Calloway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is this?	What the hell is this ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh. Why? does he live up here?	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.	I kissed him back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The fish.  Check it....	You check it....
<EOC>	<EOC>
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!	Get away from me!
<EOC>	<EOC>

I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.	I ain't got no boy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, buddy?	Can you borrow me a dime?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll have to bury him.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	The fucking New York Times.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've already robbed the safe?	Oui.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it a boy or a girl?	Oh, that's not mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!	WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --	WHAT??
<EOC>	<EOC>
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.	Charges!  Come on, come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard a strange sound...	What was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much did you part with?	Seven hundred for the pair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To your family.	To yours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	That's what you said before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.	Why are you doing this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?	You were terrific, too!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about your bags?	I never carry...baggage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?	One.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm from all over.	You was in the Marines, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She fucked you?	She fucked me.
She fucked me too.	She fucked you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found the Volvo.	Tickets?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shock.	Barrel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--	--there's thousands of 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No bleeding.	What is that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Snap out of it!	Get on to yourself!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing on those shoes?	Don't mix very well with beer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pete?	Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.	My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you continue to see him?	He needed my help.
Not because you were attracted to him?	No.
You weren't attracted to him at all?	Well, maybe a little.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Advance, Sergeant Major!	Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ever talk to him?	...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To freedom.	To the Black Pearl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well I guess...	Yeah... Bedtime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just coolin'.	You're still late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.	Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get rid of 'em.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Curious.  There's something missing.	The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Riuji?	I told you, I work for him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barker.  Jock Barker?	Baker.  Jack Baker.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Wheee!  Faster!	How fast is enough?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you ever gonna do a picture?	Not you too
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.	I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.	Am I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna kick his ass!	I'm gonna help you.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.	Cheers, Terrance!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell....	You're supposed to be dead!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Get back here, Rool!	Ouch!  Let go of me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.  I'll try anything once.	Except sex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This feels... incestuous.	Is that what makes it so delicious?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay to use the phone.	Alright!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?	Window.
Do you want a fruit plate?	I don't know.  Do I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Well. He said to ""make the house mine."""	Oh boy. If he only knew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am eternally in your debt.	And I in yours.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What just happened?	I don't know.  I lost him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, yes!  Yes!	Oh, baby!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... I can't find my seatbelt.	What do you want me to do about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh... a Dorothy.	Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Cellar door.	Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.	Like hell.  That counted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.	That's great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?	Something like that, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell them about Pauline's mum.	Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's there!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, we can't get out!	Nell, what do we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Who's this?	He works for me.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.	You like everybody, Ronald.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	You look like you have.
<EOC>	<EOC>

You've been having strange sex...!	No, Brett, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say it again.	I'd do anything for you, Dil.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can see her?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, thank God... just missed him.	Is it still dripping?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daniel, give him the Trix.	Susan, this is the future of America here.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! He looks . . . normal.	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the kitchen, under the sink.	No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.	Grandma?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's up to you ladies.	Howard!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.	We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.	I know, darling, I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.	Well you're not going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know your history.	I know my treasure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.	Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?	At Victoria's Secret.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hooker!	How ya doin', Jimmy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Actually, you sing.	Pardon?
You sing.  All the time.	I do not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do I really feel like... I am...?	Yes.  Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Raising the shields.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you later -	Righto.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?	Thirty-eight...simulated.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have the photo from the diner?	At the field office.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's Ivy?	What?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?	I wish I knew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.	Scan for vessels in pursuit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She is Lana Turner.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Al.	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me handle that.	I'm all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell her I'm very happy with it.	He's Scottish, Col.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary Clarence!	Now you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.	Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --	Just leave me alone, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.	Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, that is disgusting.	Murderer!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd she go?	Maybe she turned.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If we could relay the sunlight-	From the other side of the equator-
<EOC>	<EOC>
We were talking about my schedule...	You're going to have to get a new one.
Not an option.	Then you better start swimming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it good?	I don't know. It might be...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't say another fucking word!	About your whore of a wife?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.	What did he say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd best drop canvas, sir!	She can hold a bit longer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Jesus H. Christ.	So where's the party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
About what?	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's almost over!!	No. It's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like horror comics.	This one could save your life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You...	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tread matches. It's the car.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She wanted me to tell you--	Cole, please stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything going okay?	It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?	Not so bad, today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can I convince you to stop?	Go out with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Praetor...	FULL STOP AND FIRE !
<EOC>	<EOC>
More metal... sharp edge...	Stay to your left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's not accustomed to being ignored.	She'll have to learn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...ervices.	Uh - what? - I ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That hurt....	Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evening, Annie.	Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.	This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I really think I do.	All right then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing all alone in the dark?	Fantasizing... about you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Cynthia. John.
Not today. I've got other plans.	Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?	You know what I mean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	...you should rest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ONEÂ—TWOÂ—THREEÂ—FOURÂ—FIVE	Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Â—sixÂ—sevenÂ—eightÂ—nineÂ—	I'm out! I'm out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Floor seats.	You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.	Deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's Kathryn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what time it is?	Uum... around ten?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a passport?	Several.
Good.	Where is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll always play with me?	Whenever you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...is there?	How did you know I would be here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They have stolen state property.	What a nerve!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.	Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing in my room?	I didn't go in your room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?	Yes...
That's not what happened to your parents.	Then what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.	Bob's upset.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?	Don't ask me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scientologist.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.	What?
I'd like you to keep a journal.	A diary?
That's right.	No way.
Why not?	Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
I don't understand.	Ev-i-dence.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.	Of course.
It was just an idea.	Bad idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.	Reflect.
That's right.	You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.	How's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack!	How do you like it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are no more rooms.	Give me the phone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we go sit somewhere?	Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your leg?	Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?	Empty as a football.
And you love life?	Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poster-Kleiser.	Oh yeah?
That's right.	I'll call you.
Fine.	See you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.	Duke Forrest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what?	What?
I miss you. And I miss her.	But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ya see something down there, Chief?	Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Geez, you okay, Margie?	I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And she's all wrong for me!	Well, somet...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mara -- what -- ?!	Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,	Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not a woman!	It was a woman when we put her in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?  What's this... this picture?	That?  That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?	Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall we have a drink or something?	Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool it, Choco.	YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look like brothers.	Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?	No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Since right after we lost our son.	You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.	But John was with him at the pool?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's dead then. They must have killed him.	We don't know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rennie...	Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.	We changed our minds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They made me go with them.	Sure they did....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like poetry, Raymond?	Can't say, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Just watch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moonan. Here. Shit...	So what? We just stay clear of him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want a firm commitment.	I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Don't you hear it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So where're we going?	Anywhere but here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
IÂ’ve scheduled a medical for you.	ItÂ’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome aboard, Admiral.	Welcome home, Jim.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, well done, team 2.	And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For God's sake, what happened to me?	You don't remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry. That was rude.	Will you join me for dinner?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, it will be cold on that train.	I shall be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you saying?	You can stop. I will go on alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it the one you wanted?	Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.	Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?	[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi there.
You remember me?	No.  I don't think so--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	James Looks Twice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	I'm in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What took you so long?	Couldn't find my toothbrush.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.	How do you figure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.	It was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rub it on the windows!	What-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you seen him?	No.
oh.	Atley Jackson came to see me ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.	There probably is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whose car?	My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry...PD only.	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eric!	It won't hold!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you feeling, Fernando?	Not bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I be present?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're in?	The cheese...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that, Dad?	That's the Air Force Base.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Him too.	We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.	Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...	What about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten minutes.	I'll be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Won't come out, eh?	No, he's very upset about something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.	Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever wear one of these?	I don't ski.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna need some money.	How much?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It bit you.	No shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.	What about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck... ?!	Why are you following me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stupid cunt!	Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.	You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, Violet.	Let us go and we'll make a deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.	Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't feel bad.	Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm. Better.	Did you need it?
Yeah.	Oh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?	Yeah, refill'd be great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice.	The music? Or the fire?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A raft.	A blimp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.	What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bugs.	Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What now, Geronimo?	My truck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I agree.	I wish I could see him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What thing?	Huh?
What thing could we be in together?	I hate tears.
Is Mary... in trouble?	Yes.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?	Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just what the hell is he talking about?	We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I throw up?	Please, Drew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She disappeared... shit!	You were too far behind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good day, Mr. Chance.	Good day, Sally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the hell was your father?	Well, Dad said...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just don't want to fight with you.	Then show me who you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It won't work on you.	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think so?  How do you know?	Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He just asked me questions.	What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.	Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, Dignan.	What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.	I'm sorry, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name!	Jim.  What's yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?	Give you nose bleeds?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd I tell you?	There she is!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now black rubber.	Try a fireman. Less to take off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	I'm not...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you say his name was?	Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.	Very well, folks. I accept.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie Dalton.	Knox Overstreet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck her yet?	I'm working on it.
Loser.	Blow me.
Call me later.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good God.  What was that?	Wait, just a second...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have to backtrack, find another way down.	Forget it.  It would take days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hey, kid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the heck is up there?	Woody?  Who's up there with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.	I pray to God there is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But IÂ—	Now the lady said you may goÂ—
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jefferies.	Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?	For getting rid of that cast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what you want?	I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go and muck in.	Aye, before anyone stops us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did the chicken cross the road?	What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?	I don't know, why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, Christy -- strip.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing happened between me and Tia.	Leave.  Now.
Can I say something in my defense?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch you don't knock out a fish.	Perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything. Strong.	Canadian Club?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?	I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up guys?	Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marty...	You started filling out your college applications yet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. What if it breaks?	What if?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dinner in ten minutes.	You go dry off now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think, honey?	Delia hates it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want it on?	It doesn't matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.	Aye, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is there any way out of it?	Seems to be all around...
What about down?	I...don't know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?	...Brian hurt his foot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Jimmy...	I really don't know.
But you can't say....	<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.	...I don't know...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right! Where is he?	Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!	There IS no one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're in the approach corridor.	On my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I needed to know.	You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm a bitch.	Yes, you are.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.	Yes, he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No harm, no foul?	I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, guys ...	Big Bill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it.	I need the main wet-wall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are a beautiful woman.	It's not just inner beauty, is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Barks his concern.	No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey you!!	All right -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the broom.	I ain't getting shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I write.	Oh yeah? What kind of write?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can take it.	This time get your feet set.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We gotta break it open.	I ain't got a warrant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.	How do we find him, Kristen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.	Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In the direction you want to go.	You guys got any black capsules?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sal.	Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Kind of. You didn't know?	Sal's alive???
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kay-em you okay?	I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure this guy is cool?	You'll see for yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?	Blow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing like this back home.	Derek!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy's sick, guys.	You have the WORST flu since...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That... that... who was that?	I have no idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a fake.	Give him the card.
But--	Can you follow simple directions?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.	Doc.  Ainge...
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I come in?	Sure...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?	Â– uhh, must have forgotten-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Helen!	Matt, come here!
Why?	Come here, honey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack.  Jack.	I didn't touch it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...	Options?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.	Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?	Yes, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They way you drive, I can see why.	I...I shot a kid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to try and draw it off!	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She great or what?	Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So far away? In Xenia?	Yeah, whatever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --	You're a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!	Then your father's a wimp.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	-- Yeah... your car down here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm tired.	It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But that's not true! I've got one.	I need my sodding parents' consent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I see it! I see it!	Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?	It tastes old.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I understand.	"Then say ""Yes, Max. I understand."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I use the car tonight?	Of course, Jeffrey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?	And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why'd you leave Balincrest?	My brother went here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. But we took care of him.	How did you do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you call me up tonight?	Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kate...	Jack...God, itÂ’s been so long...You look...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been thinking about you.	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Till what?	TilT we figure something out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're a fighter?	How you know that?
I can tell.	I <i>was</i>...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you crazy?!	The guy came right at us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you remember where it is?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, Mrs. Brett!	Good night, idiot!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody call?	Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
--- What was that?	I didn't hear anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...	I got an A!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three ways, I figured.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it off.	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with us?	You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's her choice --  She's human --	Oh, as opposed to -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...	We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?	Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll torch the bases, how's that?	Torch it?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.	It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?	Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?	Had in mind something a little more radical.
What's the problem?	Death.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't this fun!	Can hardly wait to do it again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, then.	Goodnight.

<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry what I said back there.	Don't be silly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.	What do you take me for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can imagine.	Can you?  I couldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice shot.	You're an asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's going on?!	This is my area of expertise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohh?	Uh-oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still think Cuba isn't important?	Not as far as the election goes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He could see me.	I'll quit, maybe you should start.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you holding up?	I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's me.	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to see the body.	No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.	Try calling me again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go away. I might hurt you.	I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...	I don't think you'll hurt me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the invite.	Got anything to drink in there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.	Thank you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You loved him?	I'm very cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's <u>mad</u>.	-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll murder you when he finds out.	He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.	Can you move over a wee bit?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you frightened?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's dying?	Your great aunt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.	Howdy, Rhonda.
You're really leaving, huh?	You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you take me home now?	I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.	But, Elaine --
Where is the car?	I just want to tell you something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hmm. Not bad.	You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take the men. I can finish alone.	You come with me -  You stay here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.	You may kiss my hand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'd like that?	Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?	It would bring us together.
You and Regan?	You and us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chicken is a fool's game captain.	So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.	Your cannons made a compelling argument.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Swell!	Your friend was to remain where he was!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.	Mother... go away!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you do fantasize?	Yes.
About who?	I fantasized about you.
About me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We get to the bridge, we're all right!	Nick, the ice is --
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I don't know how to polka.	Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get the letter?	What letter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?	What would that make Mom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop following me.	I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.	Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.	Fuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure you do -- you win either way.	I'm supposed to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!	Yes, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --	So what happened? Where are they, then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I'm afraid I have.	What are they like? What are they about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ever call me stupid.	Come on, he didn't mean anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.	Here's to Ben.

It's so beautiful...	And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not ready? Where is she?	Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.	What about Mrs. Marschal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think about that reward, Johns.	I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not even sure what it was.	What else could've done that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing's happening!	Looks like he lied to you too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was the last time I saw him.	When was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know...	Come on, yes you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	We need to talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're lower than a dog!	Fuck you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes I do.	It explains a lot.

<EOC>	<EOC>
And the light goes out...	Frankenstein!

Where are you?  Are you there?	It's enough now.
Please.  Talk to me --	There's going to be plenty of time for that.
What do you mean?!	I think you know --
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?	Hey, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?	Because I found out about her...
About who?	Anne Lively...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!	Dad was onto something here!

<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	The traffic takes some getting used to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you gonna do?	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck is he talking about?	My rug.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't know.	Dominick said they're in the motel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That would be the first time.	When are you going to learn?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, is he dead or what?	He ain't dead.
So what is it?	I think he's just passed out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think so.	Oh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh --	Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know Dmitri?	'Fraid so.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Are you all right?	Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.	How are we doing?
The same as always.	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
<EOC>	<EOC>
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.	I don't think you're so bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Muffin.	No, you're the muffin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was first to respond.	What were you doing out here?

Oh, no. No, no, no....	Rain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She won't go to St. Cloud's!	Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...	Mr. Rose *knows*?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He killed people, Mom.	We all have bad nights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.	What room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?	And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you two going?	We're going to get my little girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Miss Dupea.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So that's it...	That's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.	Do I detect a note of jealousy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is something.	It's a smelting retort.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	You going to ask me in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.	Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!

<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we going to do?	Give him the money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen, what is this? What do you want?	I want to know who you are.

Who was that?	I don't know.
What's this?	Got me.

Somebody couldn't wait until dark.	H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.	It was only a mouthful!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to Bella?	I'll tell you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.	What have we missed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red or white?	Both, see you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is nuts.	Wade.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	It's a voice modulator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you did break out --	I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	No one ever comes here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was a friend of your sister's.	I know her friends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this stuff? Kevlar?	Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.	That's why I wear a target on my chest.
<EOC>	<EOC>

LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!	Turn over your weapon, Edna!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm my own man.	Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you...	...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?	To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello. Get me the police, please.	Where is Elaine?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she?	Call the police.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	I thought so.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  These are good.	I helped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Weather's turning nasty.	You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.

You're awake. Good girl.	What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.	Wait a moment --
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're welcome.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what to do.	That's ok, you'll figure it out.

<EOC>	<EOC>
God, I think I need a holiday.	Some deal you did there!
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
So whyÂ’d you let him go?	ItÂ’s complicated, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one for tomorrow?	The blue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See -- this is the nicest room.	Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was lucky.	I thought you were a man of God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...	...and one helluva guy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the weather down there?	Mr. Henry?
Come on in!	It's locked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Edward, I can't.	Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?	You won't.
What if someone tries to steal it?	I'll guard them and you with my life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mornin', son...	Mornin', Daddy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is mom ever coming back?	You mean for good?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone stole my stuff.	Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Count this.	Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?	Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now look what you did!	I saved your life is what I did!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
She's fine.	Well, I just thought I'd call.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy!!!	Danny!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.	That's what I call a payday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you going?	California.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?	No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?	No plants.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.	Sure. We aim to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Buckaroo Banzai.	Come on--let's parole 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not that truth!	Aren't we all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eighth room down, babe...	Guards come exactly every three minutes....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god OH MY GOD...	Starck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must go, Holiness.	A moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow, it's the red one?	Oh, it's magnificent!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Debi's house.	Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
No. You drove us here.	Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see, a tree is a living thing.	Can you create life?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It will be a good harvest this year.	Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?	I think you just like to eat dirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Susan?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right...  Come along.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
OK.	Tired of this shit...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?	Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.	Something the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Florentino!  He's getting away!	Drop his horse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now that's what I call a meal.	It's like the Garden of Eden...
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I can't be dry.	Can you watch the road?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should go.	I don't remember any of this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?	Betty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God...	Should I raise shields?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hint. It's not a geographical location.	I'm stumped.
It's inside a moving car.	Bull...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is dumb, let's find that chick.	Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.	Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.	Goddamn Geek!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cheery looking bunch.	Better living through electricity.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you remember?	No... I don't. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dade?	Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?	I'm taking over a TV network.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob Â— Charlie Brown.	Hi, Charlie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ohhhh, I don't think so...	How do you know that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Screw sleep!	Nancy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?	Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?	Blackburn's dead.
Excuse me?	He would have been back by now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never should have listened to you.	Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you find it?	No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
No-o!	Where's Lother?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess I should go.	I want you to stay with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just a mongoose.	Is it dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry?	I know how hard it can be sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to come splash around.	I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't litter my cab!	Oh, sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the power and radio setup?	Operations building.  Far end of the street.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.	I ain't wearing no gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She lived alone.	She must have known someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like it?	I love it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!	Yippy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.	Always the dentist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
OW!	I'm going to leave now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?	I don't know. It's early... I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Charlotte?	Hi, Bob.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?	Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you asking me if IÂ’m gay for pay?	I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay, man?	Elvis has left the building.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?  Aren't you?	Well. . . yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't talk that way.	Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!	I am serious.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must enjoy causing me pain!	You shouldn't have pushed us!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fletcher, get away from there...	It's burning...
Get out of there!	I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!	I can't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
On the table.	Sorry?
You have to lay it on the table.	Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You the magician?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe...  Joe...	Stop pressuring me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he say?	He said he doesn't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I asked you...	She admits it's her fault.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I go with you --	That what you want?
That's what I want ...	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This way.	Oh, man!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Six months advance pay.  Six months!	Fucking sweet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.	That's not possible.  No one can do that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take the binoculars.	Wh-what do you think--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lord's name.	Mother Mary, full of grace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Commander, I have to log it...	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.	How do you do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come in.	A message from Citizen Fouche.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about it, Ma?	I'm ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I have twenty-five cents, please?	What for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"I'm considering taking a job as a ""Goofy""."	Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to check?	I said good call.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gittes?... Gittes?	Yeah.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This fork is filthy.	The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Sean.	Come in.
Sean...	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do that. Hang up...call...	What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...	I'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...	Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I must be destroyed.	Can you get us in there, past security?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What're you afraid's going to happen?	That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry...	Then where is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
<EOC>	<EOC>
No --	I get the feeling you've done some business before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're out of Glenlivet.	What else is going on?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the advise, sir.	Keep me informed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're sort of a rude person.	It's just that--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pattee?  That your middle name?	Nope.  Maiden.
You're married.	Not anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You feeling any better?	A little bit.
Guess what.	What?
Your grandfather's here.	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me where we're going.	Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?	Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.	Hello, Mollie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.	Is that what he tells you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But	Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I loved him too much.	After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.	That's so weird...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got it.	Show us where you are, Chief.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There are no others.	Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
I don't know what you mean.	There were two old guns there; where are they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not even listening to me.	What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howdy!	Howdy to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could pass for that.	- you got to be blonde -
We could dye our hair.	- and you got to be girls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Jon.	Hello, Adrian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe you should have just a half.	Thanks for the advice dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes -- let's run!	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lied at my trial.	I don't know you, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you --	Watch out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	Great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you say, sir?	Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The food is on the table.	I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.	Ba Fa Goulle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please tell me.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.	The gunshot holds no fear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's pretty good.	Getting used to it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The hell happened?	Hesitated, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Marvosa -	What do you need?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.	Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, we're connected.	Great.
Great?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not on the same floor with Valentino!	Just follow me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take this.	And do what with it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going for you two?	Not well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Contain it and get back to me.	What do you mean by 'contain?'
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God... What is that?	That's one piece of four problems.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About clothing?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are we stopping?	There's a dog in the road.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.	Then you do think it was Ambrose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?	Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.	Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, bud.	Frank...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Those people were already dead.	Before the bomb went off?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you do to him?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--	You're a fuck, Walter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?	Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.	Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stu...LOOK!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?	Heavy weather East of here.
Whaddaya think?	Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got her arm.	Here's his head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's siesta.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I use the bathroom?	Of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two make quite a couple.	We're supposed to.
You better not be taking on a new partner.	Suspicious, after all these years?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can hit me, if you want to.	No, please. I won't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Vada.	Hi.
What are you doing.	Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch.	Betadyne doesn't hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I always wondered what happened with us.	I havenÂ’t thought about that in years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're out of your mind.	What's your point?
I will do no such thing.	Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sixpack?	Why can't we pick up his signal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something's wrong.	Keep trying!
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I?	Go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a lie!	Mr. Cedar!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, should I call Andy?	Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.	Yeah. Call him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I did.	Haven't slept, have you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't find the shotgun.	So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he? Did you lose him?	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.	Geeeerta Rauuuss!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.  Give us a kiss?	One.  In case...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?	Ten throws it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you have the answers...	Ah! You have questions?
What are we?	Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?	Surely you know the one who made you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. God no.	Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?	His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Back from where?	Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Had you.	No you didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promised!	Never.
But you did... you did!	I may have said perhaps...
Liar!	Or perchance...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why would she come here...	This is where I proposed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?	Why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That bothers you?	Yeah, maybe, a little.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?	Yes, I'm afraid I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a minute, you!	Yeah?
You're a writer, you said.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!	Shut the fuck up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.	Come here, Brenna.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Bring it on, dude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finally, some common sense...	What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.	No, I really don't.
I think you do.	Why don't you tell me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.	No! You can't! They're in on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really think I'm attractive?	For a butt-head? Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning.	Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?	Fine thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome, welcome, one and all.	Rick!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come you never talk?	She was born without a tongue.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?	"Is ""he"" inside?"
But of course...	Alone or surrounded?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get a blanket!	It's okay... we're all here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting a trajectory...	What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.	I think so, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lava?	No.
What are they?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.	Let me explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hands and knees, you say?	And terror, if you don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's Choi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...	You two ok?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing is real until it's perceived.	The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time, Pilch! My move.	No fair! You lured him with produce.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with you?	I just had a mental picture of...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who? Who did that?	Krueger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!	Laughs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	Bela died.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said something.	I know you did!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, look what I drew.	That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	This tie doesn't go with blue!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No wonder he let her go.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, here we are.	You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this.	It's Vince and Justin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it all started when a friend and I	China
<EOC>	<EOC>
xxxxxx	xxxxxx
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that all?	Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The kids take me.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you comfortable Regan?	Yes.
How old are you?	Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?	Sometimes.
Who is it?	I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't see any.	Funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, give it back.	Come and get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?	I know. Weird, huh -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you love her?	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.	Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Let's go upstairs, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'	Stop -- singing!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just my luck, no ice.	I take it you've heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Idiot...	Good help is hard to find...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't hurt him.	That all depends on you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.	What do you mean by sensible?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think that you and I are natural enemies.	And here I thought I was charming you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think John would like it?	I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Lowell.	How are you, Jim?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hi, Mom. It's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were supposed to help me with this.	You need the exercise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll keep calling.	Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roy?  Your clock broke.	Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	How's your hernia?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you explain what's going on?	Patience, lad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?	If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you up to?	Just checking out the lights.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	You're welcome.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the candy?	There is no candy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you have a heater?	Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...No, please.	Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna miss you.	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that supposed to mean?	It's a simple question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liza?	Where are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Did she hurt herself?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	...from Mavis, also.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm fine.	Ok...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.	C'mon, Laurant, America?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buckaroo--! Sorry--	What is it, Tommy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any word?	Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nails? Really?	No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	That's the good stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time is running out.	Surrender!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not your fault, Daniel.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone you have to get back to?	No.

You said you liked me.	No --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great!	Go ahead...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?	It's like this... I...we...all of them.

Dad--	Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?	Leave a tip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not going with you.	What?  What are you talking about?

Son of a bitch!	What?

What is that one over there called?	That must be Basiluzzo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Adds flavor....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you... are you hungry?	I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?	Well, I thought it was safe--
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?	Is *what* getting me down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, I quit!	Yeah?
Yeah.	Yeah?

<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Please...	Which way do you want to go?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd I do?	"Stay cool. Just remember to call him ""God."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is crazy.	That's why it will be so much fun.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Beautiful day, isn't it?	How can you be out here?
<EOC>	<EOC>

At what time will you be available?	Three oÂ’clock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...?  Shall we go?	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.	It's one thing to know it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like that?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd better go in.	I only live up there and across the roof.
Thanks anyway.	Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you get it?	The Russian would be easier.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shut down accelerators.	Accelerators down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't she lovely?	Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...	We love you, Baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well. That about does it.	Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.	So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Miss Harrington.	How do you do, Mr. Richards.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!	What you wanna do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's bringing a girl?	Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?	He wouldn't say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're yours.	They are?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't like this, this...	Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How come it's my responsibility?	Because....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you care for a drink?	Yes. Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like to kiss her goodbye.	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?	Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you drinking, love?	I've forgotten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't he kill us?	He has given up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Relax.  We'll drop the song.	Guess I got a little scattered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with it?	You look like you just crawled out of bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool ropes.	I braided them.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.	Time I had lots of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't you stop it?	If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, she was here.	Where'd she go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Seems a little loose!	She'll do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing, Cato?	Not bad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I guess you admire musicians.	Some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	Nothing, go back to sleep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cheer up, darling.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claire...	DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now they feel it...down below.	Radiation level...constantly rising...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You better not either.	Well, let's spit on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...	What did you need?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about money?	I never needed money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my goodness ...	How about you?  Are you going to win?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you shaking?	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...	...not the Lazyboy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't feel anything.	Oh, Jesus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It worked out alright, didn't it?	Fuck off!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just get her drunk.	How 'bout the key?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.	What do you have in the house?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....	You have an ATM?
Yes.	Is this where you live?
Yes.	You have another house somewhere or something?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Urrggghh...	Warren!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.	Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am also liaison between these two.	Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, Sandro... Please...	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?	Wait!  I'm a friend!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is monstrous!	Yes, and very beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait!  There's people down there!	There's people up here!
Get it out of here!	Take it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like this?	There's nothing in the stores.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.	What?  What do you mean you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!	Are you alright ?
I've been better.	Your father told me you were working here.
If I make it through the day.	I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spooky.	Charlie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pÃ¢tÃ©.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sometimes you just have to -	Don't say it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
First of all -	What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.	I'll get you some coffee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Check you later, man.	Hi Gina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No deal.	I'm afraid we can't let you go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.	We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's egghead?	His kid's sick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do the police think?	They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am Comrade Buljanoff.	Monsieur.
May I ask how much your rooms are?	Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I help you?	This your store?
Yes.	Think I could rent a scooter?
You have ID?	Not really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, I'll do you right here.	God have mercy on my soul.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Hit it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about him?	Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we free, Buljanoff?	Possibly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck!!	Huh... that's strange.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you call the State Police?	All their lines were busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...	Come on, gal...
<EOC>	<EOC>
"That's a ""j."""	"For ""James?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
We had to finalize the deal.	Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.	I know. It won't go unnoticed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much does it cost?	Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.	No, no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.	If it did get to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well --	Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold the phone!	I'll have it in a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't make it worse, Dad.	Always.
<EOC>	<EOC>
COME ON!	HELLLLLLLLP!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Find him?	Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
<EOC>	<EOC>
See he was cheating from the get go.	He's been running money for the Mafia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So we can finally talk?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?	Straylight. Kitchen dock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red Dragon.	That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.	You're upset, that's alright.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we doing here?	Living.  Remember?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's me.
Who?	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything good?	Raptors, mostly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.	...and put them in your mouth.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Wait!	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And white.	Easy black boy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex, what is it?	Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hang on, hang on.	Let's go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Gittes?	Yes?
Do you know me?	Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?	Well, no.
Never?	Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	You don't wanna know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.	But...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't grab it...	Run the subscription list...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.	Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...to him.	What are you trying to say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it, then.	That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.	Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you said you'd show me your place.	Not tonight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody broke in.	Now who'd go and do...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merry Christmas.	A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you gotta hit them straight on!	Got it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sssh!	Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...	Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This'd better not be what I think it is.	Okay!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.	I can't see 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not certain about...	Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like we're it.	More to the point. Where's our host?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm okay.	Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, God.	He is so bald.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Martin.	Martin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A meteor?	No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?	Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?	It's... slowing down, Sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they still out there?	Negative...they vamped.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!	I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.	Maybe you can tell me then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --	It's Dave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.	I have no family.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"I'm sorry, did you just call me ""Lotte""?"	Do you mind?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, Comrade.	Have you any money?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wouldn't like Razinin.	He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, thanks a lot.	But he never talked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to get going.	I am not flexible on this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
John.  John, you all right?	Longbranch...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Getting there.	You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We still going?	Honda 250, huh?
That's right.	C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Almost got it.	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're right here.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh hi.  Forget something?	I forgot my bag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. We're gonna be okay.	Did you get help?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the -	We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just don't drop the ball, okay?	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't mean to get personal.	Yes you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.	Don't start a war on my wedding day!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back where?	That's the idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You fainted.	Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?  How much do I owe you?	My salary.  Two-fifty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nix, the law!	Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did it! I did it! We won!	We won?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a hell of a lot of money.	What, you think there's something funny about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two years!?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure is pretty.	What'd you come out here for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claude...?	And you call me a moron...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We start from scratch--	Yeah--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want a room here?	Do you smoke?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he awake?	I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.	It's really quite all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much sleep do you need?	How much sleep?
How long can you go without sleep?	That depends.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank God!	What a relief!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many guys they have on you?	I counted four.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing on the reservation?	I'm on my way back in. Over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come with me.	Where are we going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't hear any--	Shut up and listen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you, Mr. Leland?	Certainly not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think he's here?	Here?
In Costa Blanca.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the hell is he?	Who the hell knows!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buzzy... Buzz...?	Yeah... Sid?
Right, you got clicks, anything?	Nah, nuthin' on my end --
<EOC>	<EOC>
...yes.	Look -- it ticks!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twenty thousand dollars.	Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.	Very good, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.	I'm a gracious host.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where we killed him.	You didn't try hard enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ok.	Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
No honey.	You are upset.
I'm not.	I thought you'd be pleased.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.	So do you.
How's everything?	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
D'Artagnan, unready?	At a ball, everyone watches the King!
<EOC>	<EOC>
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.	Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.	Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.	I got a new deal for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's still back there!	I know.

Shall I tell them again?	Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --	Ah, come on -- we're going home.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.	I came back.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
For Jefferson High. For books.	Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.	I didn't say you did.

<EOC>	<EOC>
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.	Just open the door, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?	I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank Abolofia.	The Wolf?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Prints?	Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?	Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he do?	He hit a guard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.	I think I'll do what I damn well please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Offering it for debate.	It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.	Would that include me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't walk out here.	It's mine all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's about my brother ... Kip...	Yes ... Kip ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Al, are you doing anything in there?	What? What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --	Stop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.	Now you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight, Daddy...	Goodnight to you, son...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you see me right now?	Uh-huh.

You're interfaced with our dish.	Gimme the coordinates?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, you still here?	We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
<EOC>	<EOC>

I'm me... I mean, that's me.	Step inside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kate, is something the matter?	Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...	I think he's having an affair.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think Cathy's all right?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	They fired me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	I have to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Make it official, if you like.	What is your nationality?
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon, man.	You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --	-- I didn't see you from the window.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'd need charges.	We could convert fission transistors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She did that deliberately.	She's a beast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's mad.	No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How shall we get out now, Leon?	Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sleeping in my room.	I see.
I'm not scared.	That's great.

Rod's not a lunatic.	You got a sane explanation for what he did?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait, I wanted her to do it.	Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kirsty... Kirsty?	It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man, you're losing your audience.	Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That isn't what you said before.	I was wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scared?	No. You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.	Don't get burned, Daphne.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to go outside?	Naw, right here's okay.

Somewhere in between.	Do you have a lover now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?
Those things in your hands.	These? What are THESE? They're swords.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...	It's okay. Can I sit down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jawohl!	Some are not bad at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, you've never liked me...	Don't flatter yourself.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...	Nobody likes a snoop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?	A what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.	Yeah.

We lost our key.	Where did you lose it?

He went back for his brother.	We said 48 hours.

Was Zavitz in trouble?	I don't know.

Viewer discretion advised!	You want the tape?  There it is!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where the van was parked.	Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...	Look, it's a longshot...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would they go over my girdle or under?	Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A lie?	An error.

An interface attendant.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm so scared...	Don't be
<EOC>	<EOC>
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.	How do I know you are cops?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How?	We don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Kane -	That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!	Get away from here.
I'm hungry.	I mean it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coming?	What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.	Why didn't you say so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.	Yeah.  Neat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you stopping?	Weight Station.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
You love me then?	Of course I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fire escape??	Don't have one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me, Grace, help...	Like you helped her, Jake?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.	The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Milo?	Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a great idea, Shorty.	I told you it would taste just like chicken.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're keeping an eye on me.	Who's keeping an eye on you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whose statue is that?	I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you leave me?	I didn't leave you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's a butfor?	For pooping, silly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't tell us you had this on!	My Lord, he was telling the truth!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to talk to you.	Doug, this is Mr...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your uncle will like this.	He's not really my uncle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's just go, Marsha.	No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.	Why won't he talk to women?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He can be no other.	Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.	Next time lets put some money on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.	Did you hear me?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I already told him I was home.	There you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.	I'll be back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?	I take it I should. I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very nice. What is it?	Mary Had A Little Lamb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You busted?!	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably on their first date, right?	It's a narrow view.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm on the scent.	You're too late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he say?	I'll never tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Movement!	Position?
Can't lock up...	Talk to me, Hudson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That has no place in this house.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Car wash, Captain?	Absolutely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is really happening, isn't it?	[Beat] What do you need me to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Figures.	We've been set up all along.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	For me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It just slipped out.	It happens.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?	That will never happen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Yaay!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --	He's a good soldier, Jude.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much?	Twenty eight hundred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put that down!	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That really happened?	Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get close to them.	That place. By the window.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was I?	Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You sound like you mean it.	The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?	You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get this?	I found it outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He sucks soup through his front teeth.	A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.	It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it's legit.	Maybe.  I'll call him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, I know it's hard to believe...	So what's our problem?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So now you'll have a mother.	I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.	He likes her better than me.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.	Then go home, baby.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.	Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?	No, I'm hiding out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.	S'okay....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Just have you for one second, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.	Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.	Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can use a shot of what he's got.	... Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?	This must be... very, very, hard on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Amazing. I'm Johns.	Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.	Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, Carlo?	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Danny...	I can't make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A lot of Persians?	Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get it?	Leave me alone -- !
<EOC>	<EOC>
.....Me neither.	<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah...	Here -- take this instead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?  You just face planted!	I know how it feels to be dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tom?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother fucker!	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the same prevision.	Not quite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh -- yes. Wood?	What?
Wood or wire? They have both.	Either one will be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to go home now.	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.	Who is he? What have you got me into?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.	I'll go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a big help. Where are you from?	From?
Are you from up there? Space?	Space?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What am I doing here?	Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son-of-a-bitch.	We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's in Memphis?	Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...	Sure thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Committed to memory.  Forever.	I see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.	Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus...	What is it? Where's Casey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is it?	Were taking you back to the nurse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Absolutely not.	They're here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex, please-	Shut up!  Who is this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, thank you very much.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.	That's crazy -- why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Studio B.	Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?	No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It will be a hard break.	She's young. She'll get over it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?	No, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	I'll live...
<EOC>	<EOC>
"What do you know about ""the changes""?"	Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Operator.	I need an exit!  Fast!
<EOC>	<EOC>
...reconcile with Emily.	Are you there to not reconcile with her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's only a little way, Mr. August.	I'd like to get out of here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And I would like to see a priest.	Now?
Yes.  I didn't confess today.	Right.  Raymond... a priest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you renounce Satan.	I do renounce him.
And all his works?	I do renounce them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Come on.  Ease off the girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't move my arm.	You've got good days and bad days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I remember you...in the elevator.	That's right.
You were very nervous.	It was because I had this...in my pocket
<EOC>	<EOC>
No... You come back to me Louis...	Are you mad????
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mama, that was a great dinner.	It certainly was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Paul, how the hell are ya'?	I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
They moved you from the Diplomat?	Promoted. House Manager.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a .44 Magnum?	That's an expensive gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll be alive.	With a man in my head...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.	You like it? I'll send you a box.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm in your debt, Screwball.	Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure. I met you.	Oh. What's happening about the opera?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want anything to drink?	You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right, Ethan?	Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mean to tell me we're dead!	I guess so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cut.	What are you doing that for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.	Of course I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're being hailed.	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This... how long did this attack go on for?	Seconds.  Three, four.
And this is how he came to the boat?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fifteen percent skim?	Twenty-five this time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think he's got a terrific personality.	You know, he was formerly a sailor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I get her for you?	No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's with us...	He's with us... He's with us...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was devastated.	Go figure you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alexander...?	Orion's belt...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the?...	Russian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jackie?	Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?	Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.	Do you got something for me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.	Neither are we.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?	I married into it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that it ?	Yeah, I'd say that's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to die.	Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	Oh yes, always.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clean.	What do you mean, he's clean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck... !	I promised him to Machine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe it's true then what she said.	What did she say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nichts danke. Kein.	Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's the pilot?	It's automatic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Chauncey... Chauncey...	Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ouch.	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're back!	How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.	Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was Beth's idea.	I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you didn't do anything about it?	No.  I didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	My house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You son of a bitch!!	Not very often.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy money!	Where'd you learn all this stuff?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this a lover?	Please!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you no shame?	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go now.	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.	What are you saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?	It's stupid, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lose the hardware now.	We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Son.  This lady's here for you.	I know.  Hey Nadia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And my compliments to you...	Alice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Remember the Alamo?	I beg your pardon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?	All I need--
<EOC>	<EOC>
85,000 dollars.	Missing????
<EOC>	<EOC>
Open that door, damn you!	Daddy, what's the matter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.	What do I do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're good.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's it look like?	It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.	I've looked at it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's nothing in it!	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baby, what is it?	I'm thirsty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George? Was he alone?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it nice?	The Soho Grand?
Yeah.	You're from LA, right?
Yeah.	You'll love it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My lady!	Who is there?
<EOC>	<EOC>

I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.	You just might.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One is all?	For now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take all the time you like, doctor.	I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are YOU doing here?	You may need a real Berserk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How should I know?	Murray.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You like pornos?	Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.	No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...	Here's hoping, baby...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. MacFarlane --	Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, Mr. Kane.	Not my wife - not either of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Christ	You knew Sergeant West?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I canÂ’t stay here.	YouÂ’re not going to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No they're not.	Annabelle put down that camera.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?	"His horns. He files 'em. To ""fit in."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you?!	Someone who believes in miracles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.  Think we're had.	Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.	Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moi?	Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	All right, darling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calm down. Take a deep breath.	You're right. You're right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, what the hell is going on?	Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what he said. Jimmy.	Hi, Jimmy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Moliere?	Fuck off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.	This I know, Benny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck!  We did it!	Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
With an unloaded pistol?	I'll explain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does she like what in bed?	Like what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She costs a hundred thousand lire.	You're kidding!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.	Look, I don't know what this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't open that now. It's warm.	Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I give you a lift?	Oh, no thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's all this dirt in the yard?	I... I... I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?	Without any future?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	Come on, move it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I did say he could go.	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your business, Jake?	Pretty good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stan! Stan are you okay?!	Wendy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't hear you come in.	What're you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One thing bothered me.	I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	I've never met anyone like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.	Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you, Whistler?	I'll show you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The sewers.  Of course.	Hurry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This guy LaPlante won an award?	"""For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scottish.	Tom Jones?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scottish?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the fuck taught you to fly?	He did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What am I looking for?	God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like more tea?	No thank you, I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you ever doubt it?	I had relinquished doubt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
For yuh.	Okay, that's good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe that is his boat.	Gimme a break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she?	Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I smoke a jay?	Bunny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you love me?	Why do you love me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	Wait!... Look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where should I look then, Cole?	Look over there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.	You don't need to cuff me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any tattoos Brad.	Certainly not!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.	I don't know you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.	She sure can pick 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?	What are you talking about?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?	Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?	Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	Looks like you know a song.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't know which side you were on.	Now you know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.	Locate.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.	Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...	I got one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you hear that?	Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.	Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.	Have fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	Sorry?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.	Yeah?  Outta what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!	You owe me a quarter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready for another?	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.	I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?	That's what the guy said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn it!	I didn't even see them fire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She told you, didn't she?	What did she tell me, Beth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pretty good speech, Maggie.	I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!	Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been here twenty years.	Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?	That's too long.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have a good trip.	Sleep tight, sweetie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.	What are you saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He was my father.	IÂ’m sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have they found our friend?	Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.	They found an eyelash.
Where?	In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?	Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't!  Stop!	Why?  They're only noodles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.	Yes?
I found it.	Did you see it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit, that dork is Jam.	YO, DOOFUS!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.	I beg your pardon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to cut his windpipe...	You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, we're in business.	Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.	Like hell you are.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.	<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I assume this is on Rex?	Isn't everything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She own you, Jimmy?	Yes.
She from Scotland too?	You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know you're not talking to me...	I'm sorry, he's on medication...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going down there again?	Yes.
After what happened to us?	I know I can capture it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're back, boychick.	Sid, how are they hanging?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye, Yonson.	So long, Hildy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!	Oh, oh!
I feel faint.	Ooh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not for us?	No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I'm gonna puke.	<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, yes it is!	"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe this isn't a good idea.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?	Umm ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever think about running away?	All the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Valiant!  You surprised me.	That was the idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm hungry.	Just your imagination.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.	You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like to read?	I can't read. Nobody taught me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe!	Come over here where I can see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiya, Lou.	Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May God be with you.	'And with your spirit.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. I'm outta here.	Excuse me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-night dad.	Good night kiddo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's he barking at now?	He's still barking at me. He's blind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you ask?	It was in a book at school. Concubine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's my partner.	You well-heeled, partner?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your name?	Mulet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who did this?	I told you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!	Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.	Mmm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... dick?	Dick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not now, Mom.	Wake up, we're in trouble.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?	Read the inscription on the cover!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow! My foot's asleep!	Come on - let's go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, man.  What else could it be?	Why bring it here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
My god. I think that was a MiG.	A MiG? Where the hell are we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.	You're not going, are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell him we gotta go.	Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The King, huh? Nice going.	I try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give it to me!  Yes!	Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, son.	How're you doing, Sarge?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, just an idea I had.	She's very beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or if there's a full moon.	Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.	That's too bad.
I have to see you.	Hey, stop by the shop.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or I might end up with a broken nose.	Did that hurt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call the Coastguard?	Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why you looking around so much?	I don't know. I got a feeling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't like me?	I love you. I want to have your baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!	I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
<EOC>	<EOC>
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!	Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.	Aye, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks	Give it back Nicholas!
But we made a business deal.	What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.	Baron!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have materials for the side bearings?	I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That boy's got talent.	And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!	Maybe he likes older women.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?	I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wish to close this account today?	That's correct.
How would you like the funds?	American currency.
This will take some time.	I have all day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sister Mary Patrick?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No game.	The phone call.  The knapsack.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just don't show fear.	I don't know what's going on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look kinda lost yourself.	But I think I know where she'll be....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	Nick, we can't just --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?	That seems likely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George, what do you think you're doing?	Let me go, Bob!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... remember.	You were ALL human!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn it! You canÂ’t fucking walk away from this!	ItÂ’s up to you whether they walk or not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.	There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.	Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.	Then what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suzy!	Hi, Marty!
What did you do to your hair?	What did you do to yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never mind. What's your name?	Belle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.	You want a chaser?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll be right there.	Where?
Dinner...tonight.	Oh...I can't. Business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're so bossy.	You're leaving me here alone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tim, I have to tell you something.	Oh.
It's about me.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What does he look like?	You might be disappointed.
Why?	Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you will?	No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, the stones are mine!	You're betrayed Shiva.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's in the case?	Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say?	I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shoulda brought my gun.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?	Sort of.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Had enough?	Even the alarm didn't wake him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready for number three?	Let's go.
Longitude 109 --	Wait... He knows.
What?	'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Gary?	Just do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't print that!	He grins wolfishly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the hurry?	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?	I figured you already heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow!	What's the matter?
It's too rough.	Since when?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.	Help me with two minutes of silence!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Willis?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because he is John Doe, by choice.	When do we get to question him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The clock's already ticking.	Right, then...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you looking at, young man?	How long were you married?
Long enough.	You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?	Sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Deputy Director, get out, sir.	What are you doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Peace conference...	Nice place to start, don't you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see where Palantine got the nomination.	Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's where the buggy stopped.	Okay, let's take a look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is he saying these things?!	They're gonna lynch him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hello, Bob, it's me.
Hello?	It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?	Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.	Do you want to-
What?	Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Yeah.	Zoe, come say hello to your father...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hit him again.	INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When will I hear from you?	As soon as is humanly possible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are we doing?	I think everything's ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck to you, Annie.	You too, Diane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Baxter.	What do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you find him?	I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sixteen dollars.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	They all get the wrong idea.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	What?  What, that guy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feel good?	Yeah.
Where do you want to go?	I want to take a walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See? The Princess is under there ...	Ah! Let us begin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...	Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kicker, anything?	Negative.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But would we get the phones back?	Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mm.	Good?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...	Where the hell is she?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that a threat, Detective?	When it's a threat, you'll know it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!	Uh--could--could I help--?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't.  It's horrible.	Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?	Good question.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right on time, baby.	Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
We're on our way, Baby.	Let's go all the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.	Surely you can do anything you want.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for coming.	I missed ya.  What can I say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Valerie's crying!	She's so nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me the gun.	Her pretty head.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't snore.	You do - repeatedly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There it is, good as new.	Give the flower a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay, man? You okay?	I didn't want to eat this much, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I pick that way.	Okay.  Then we go this way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.	Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.	I'll be waiting on deck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I vote for the motel.	My kinda group!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have been lonely?	I am lonely, Yuri.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The elevator broke.	Where's Applejack?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. So who the fuck does?	Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And do nothing. Just sit there.	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stuttering Stanley!	S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!	S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--	--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
<EOC>	<EOC>
MacReady!	Look, I'm just guessing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.	Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then we might as well die rich.	I'm not going to die for this!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck kind of questions are those?	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?	I said, yeah, about once a week!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.	No, indeed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mine!	You guys have been so colossal...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moving along quite well.	Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.	Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You sure, Eddie?	Yeah, yeah--go home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Major, you'd better take a look at this.	Hawkins?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I better not come in.	I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.	I know where you're going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Han! Chewie?	Lando!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Rand...	You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Boone.	Have a drink?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mister, what are you dragging me into?	I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Cover your mouth.	What?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.	All the bears gonna be walking today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not in a very good mood.	You don't miss a thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, y'all! What's going on?	Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this where no one stays?	Yeah, that's right, that's it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your suit, Becky!	Just get in yours!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's 350 pages long.	Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we shouldn't go.	The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you know --	I don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
About three hours.	Cause?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry about --	Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.	You don't know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You went to my high-school?	No.
Then how do you know about --	-- You told me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long ago.	Fifteen minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Jack. Jack.	Hrnrnrn?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	You go in for dangerous things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi sport.	Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, thanks for the ride.	Look out!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, babe.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Charlie!	What a treat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- May I? It's so --	Please --
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are.  Out you come.	Oh my God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My room!	Mine, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give that a try.	All right!
<EOC>	<EOC>
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE	It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE	What a shame!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS	Pay attention...
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!	Were you wicked?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two down. Two to go.	"""Down?"" Wait, don't tell me."
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.	You noticed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	We're not moving fast enough for him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.	All right, Jack, all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not bein' quite fair.	What's there to be fair about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is good.	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?	Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never saw that before.	No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?	You did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anybody we know?	Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your breakfast, monsieur.	I don't feel like any breakfast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
An unmarked police car.	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not responsive --	Ben!  Ben!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you stand up for me?	Okay.
Come on. Inside.	Okay. We'll go for a ride.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Follow you where?	Down to my car.
Why?	It's a surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...	Could have...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know I do know the way home.	It's late.
Not that late.	Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right.  No. That's nice.	If there's a train.
What do we do if there isn't?	We walk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.	I had it coming from someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Milo. What's up?	Well -- you sent for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?	You tell him, I stutter!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And there's the Sphinx.	The who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's another one. They're all over the place.	They're explosive charges.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.	He's an undertaker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're out of your mind.	He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.	We're at war.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Don't wait Efor me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.  Why not?	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All of it?	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes, sir.	I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.	You've missed this bit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?	Yes, I would like to see Ben.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.	Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'	What? Why am I bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show me.	Here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you going to do?	I loved you, Madeleine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.	Maximum ECM!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"No, look!  It's ""OPE - Recall Mistake."""	Recall what mistake?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sit down, Gino!	No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?	Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd it go, son?	She misses me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! I look ridiculous!	Come out! I can do alterations.
You'll laugh.	I shant!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?	Ten miles back on the Texas side.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ABSOLUTELY NOT!	Come on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.	And I'm the better outlaw.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who'll I aim at?	Whoever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! Bond!	Bond!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.	Have you been replaced?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight.	Goodnight, Miss Wells.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?	It's Benjamin.
Yes?	Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?	Can you look through the glass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a drink?	No thanks.
Have a drink.	Okay, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I only dog paddle.	Veer left. Left. Left!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dream on!	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.	I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.	Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clarence...	Let me handle this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.	Should I slap him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to read it? It's to you.	Yes, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sick.	Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Peter, what can I do for you?	An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.	Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.	Really, Professor, I--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that...?	The Matrix?  Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got it.  Piece of cake.	Go!  I'll finish here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Chairman?	Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Julie! Wait! You okay?	I'm fine.
You sure?	I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.	We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, We aren't going to do it.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.	Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've done some questionable things.	Also extraordinary things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Men?	Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, top secret file.	Come on.  Hand over.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Otho?	It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't hang up!	<u>What</u>?...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.	I'll just set it right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop farting around....	Stop busting my hump....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that you?	Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?	Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything wrong?	Let's hope not. License and registration please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope you're going to invite me in?	Everybody is at home, it's no good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bullshit. He's a liar.	News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.	It's their Presidential Suite.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad, could you close the door?	H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you marked like this??	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She'll be out in a moment.	Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You drink too much.	When are you going to take off that mask?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.	Did one of those things grow inside her?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?	Yes...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Channel open, Captain.	This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!	Do it!  Just do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take the hood off, Fergus --	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go near the bowling alley.	"Bowling ""Center""!"
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.  No.  Yes.	Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
<EOC>	<EOC>
About ten. Fifteen is good.	Fifteen for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was good.	He heard everything we were saying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whatcha reading?	Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bollock naked with his socks still on?	They do that up North.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Y'mean frame him?	You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Are you attracted to me?
Yes.	Why?
Why?  I don't know.	Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is nicer than your other apartment.	It's not that nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you know Speck was a killer?	The little piggie speaks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I guess you got what you came for.	Nicole...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, I don't use guns.	There is nothing to it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think we're O.K.	Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.	Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.	I'll get home all right now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	I said, I'm not my sister.
I know that.	Do you?
Of course, I do.	Very well, then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's more	Expensive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Praise Jesus!	I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  No thank you.  I have work.	I heard about Thorkel's order--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You some kind of fugitive or something?	I was trying to get away from someone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nancy...	I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's disgusting!	...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.	Three...two...one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait...don't leave me in here...	It's for your own protection.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.	Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me your hand.	Oh, my God...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Never was anybody like you...	You can't take anything seriously.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?	I suppose so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You took over for Doctor Yolander?	Yes... why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	The mean old man with the claws.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God. It's coming out.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wild card.	Drop the gun, Walter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now put it back in.	Give us a break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want some?	No, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's impossible.	It's a miracle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How bad are you, pal ?	Been better, buddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We just smeared a skunk.	Shit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This was before her pregnancy?	About two years before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max?	Let her go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?	Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. I just got busy.	That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be it.	This could be it.
Let's work on it.	Let's work on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, too.	Now she tells me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!	Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!	Ahh, look, right now's not very...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not an easy situation.	I know it isn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carmen...?	Excuse me...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
With computers.	It's not the same, is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Master safety.	Master Kong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come into the study a minute.	Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you.  I always will.	Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	Was up bitch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need something to keep me awake.	Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks.  Just some pills.	Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have some change!	Ram it up your ass!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then get out!	Mark!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Awwww, buddy --	And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I see.	...I know this must look... funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, there are, aren't there.	Why do they tell little kids that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What reputation?	Observe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's just an assignment.	It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.	I got two years.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I walk with you a ways?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll wait... back there.	Hamish, I... thank...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I had an awful dream.	What, Jim, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Henry Clerval.	Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your take?	What's the point?  It's going down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
IT WAS MY TURN!	YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They get some turnout for this stuff.	It's the best thing there is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get in the CAR!	How'd you know my name...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Murphy to Epps.	Epps, over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Your civil rights have been overridden!	Open it, Captain!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where we headed?	You'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nell --	-- how much is this car worth?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mike... Mike... Mike...	"""Mike?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who to?	None of your business...  Take another letter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.	Like he meant it.
Yeah.	Like he would find Dignan. One day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	What's wrong with her -- ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gage's gone!	Jesus, the road!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A bus?	Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding me.	As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?	Tell her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?	How'd you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh --Mr. Alexander?	What?
Is this dangerous or anything?	No more than the usual.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you promise me that?	I promise.
All right. Kisses to you.	No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.	No, kisses to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.	Thank you, Sire!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want some mustard with this?	No, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That would take weeks.	Months.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?  Where's the rest?	I guess that's all of it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you talking about?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, my feet are cold...	My feet hurt...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?	Can we keep him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And Elizabeth has hers.	Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you, Mother?	Well, I made it through another night.
How's your hip?	Oh, just so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's important to observe everything.	I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long has he been in there, son?	About twenty minutes.
Is he on his own?	Just carrying a bag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll see you there.	Right behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You what?	It was fifteen minutes late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome to ya. What's your name?	Edward Bloom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.	What'd you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who was that?	Someone from the village.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're leaving right now?	Yes.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You were how long on this?	Forty-three days.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.	I am a tourist.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !	I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.	I don't even know if you're my girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...	- He's got them on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How ya doing?	What?
What's that?	What did you say?
I said how's it going?	I didn't hear you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You haven't told me where we're going.	Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father, I think you should rest.	No, I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa. What?	We're going to give him the money back?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.	My father sent you to test me. Music then?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stomach again.	No way!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, boy.	She's been leaving messages here too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?	Through the ass.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we should call a doctor.	No.  I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cindy, what's going on?	It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	No problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your dad?	Said he'd be home later.
Later when?	I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were great in the play, Cole.	Really?
And you know what else?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We need to talk --	Seven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want to know?	Because I like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh Lord!	That fool. That damn fool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes! Free concert!	Alright, Pony!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a spike in it?	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo.	How's the ice break?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this?	Now you need me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The elevator wasn't working?	No, it has a mind of its own.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We lost it....	Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....	Maybe it's gone....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like kissing me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you looking at me like that?	Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.	No I'm not.  I'm not star--
<EOC>	<EOC>
It won't be easy.	Just hold me.
It will be rough.	Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.	You're with me even when you're away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agent Cole.	I need you to find something in the basement...
Already there.	That hoist, with the winch...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck--??	--I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He will come for me.	He will not come. You will be my queen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't touch a thing.	Don't worry!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not so rough, honey.	Good night.
Good night?	The party's over.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?	It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait!	Willful creature, that one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whadaya say?	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.	Need to get in that building?
No really?	There a story in that building?
Possibly.	Gale Weathers would find a way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need to squeeze this brain.	Answer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My lord.	Come in, Admiral.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stand up, John. Let them see you.	Oh no, I couldn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?	Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.	There you are dead wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man against nature, right Travers.	What about it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I made no deal!	I don't buy that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait'll you see the inside!	Can't wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.	I have something even better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are the miners?	Something BAD happened here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you my man?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?	Soon, Captain... Quite soon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That'll be thirty-eight cents.	You in a big hurry, boy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't you back off?	You want some too?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a fuckin' job.	His or ours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?	Memory lane.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roberto, what the fuck?	We just want to check your pack --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I beg your pardon?	There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it!	You'll lose the signal!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Close the door, Raymond.	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
HOLD it! HOLD it in!	DEATH TO DRAGONS!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't swear on these.	What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sarah.	We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beats me.	How long have you been a smoker?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is THAT Odin?	You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're family, Caesar.	No!
Gimme the gun.	I can't.  I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was your trip? Profitable?	We'll be broke in four weeks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...	Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything wrong... ?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know how to follow a map?	Yes.  I can even read star maps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cool it. We got business.	Yeah, dickhead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now's when you tell me who you really are.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well - ?	I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are those just button buttons or...?	Of course not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Moreover --	Moreover --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wrong number?	No, it's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know where my heaven is.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It won't hold.	One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's going on!?	Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good god, boy! Yell!	Yawp!

LOUDER!	AHHHHHH!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.	I think...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.	Really?
Yeah.	Very well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This must be the last straw.	Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are we going here, Jimmy?	Look on it like a honeymoon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!	Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?	I told you! I've got everything!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you out of your fucking mind?!	Fire's out, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my babies.	Anais, it is so good to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When they get mad, it gets cold.	Them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've seen only one movie? Which one?	"""King Kong"". It's really good."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.	I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what we're going to find out...	I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.	They'll never take me alive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	What do we do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	My <u>tail</u> itches.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found it... It's just not there.	What are you saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you mind if I'm on top?	Oh, either way works for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?	Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.	It's important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you see?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Noooooooooooooo!	Where did you learn to shoot?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...but first, you have to tell me something...	Anything... just ask.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everybody wants something.	Not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think you were too hard on Weathers.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Love your enemies""..."	"Good.  But ""love your enemies""... body and soul."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I kill her?	I don't think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd he say?	Who cares?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.	You don't say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll see about that.	I am.  Are you a climber?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now you know what I know.	Sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take a message.	It's alright. I'll get it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Figgers.	...He had a bald skull and...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!	Oh, your kids are so adorable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should we bring the police into this?	No, not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is Reed?	Victor must've taken him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Misha! Misha!	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll find him.	ALIVE.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.	Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Her father.	Right. And how did she dress him?
... Like Prince Charming.	Nice ... Nice ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is baloney!	"He superimposed your head onto ""Scarface."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well I want you to see the house.	I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!	It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Sit down!	You talk as if I were Asta.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rebecca -- take these off.	Tonight we open new doors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean grammar?	The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I say something personal?	Please
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus!	It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or perhaps they're on the surface.	Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  He's never done that before.	Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?	Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
No.	Can I give you my testimony?
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- just not always in the sexual sense.	You're hurting me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're going to rob that bank.	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right.	The sensitive type.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes! That's it!	I thought so!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!	No--I--I'll take a walk--
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't lead him into the other hull!	We don't have a choice!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn barbaric is what it is.	Could be meant as a warning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Look!
<EOC>	<EOC>
L.A.P.D.	<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.	Good!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's us.	I don't want to get up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hard man to live with.	How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.	That's no bull.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit.	Back up. Go out the other way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where to, Miss?	To the stars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Need to lose some weight.	Shut yo' ass up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Outside.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What would you like, beer?	No, just a coffee.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ally Jones.	How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.	I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.	And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here. How about some breakfast?	No -- I don't want anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	It's Elvis...
Who?	It's me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.	But why all nudes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's bona fide!	He's a suitor!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --	That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many bodies, Greenly?	Eight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.	Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.	It's entirely mutual.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What it will be.	How did you get in here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, did you hear that?	What, sir?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hide quickly!	What are you going to do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Do you know who I am?	Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Think I should buy some originals?	...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.	That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anyway, down here, take a look...	McCaffrey, hold this for us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened to you, then?	How'd you find me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on, fetch.	I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- don't you want to --	Jackie, can we --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't call him a dipshit.	You do --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay with him.	Wait!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.	Not yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There we are!	Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think I did it?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here!	Don't Duff--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spaceship.	Alright Buzz, get ready...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can climb out.	Climb out to where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're ready for you, sir.	Showtime.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?	Not yet.  They're working on it now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me again -- what's my name?	Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?	I took sleeping pills.
Do you know where you are, Fran?	No.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!	Never show mercy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well that's great. There goes MIT.	I'll make it up to you!
How?	I'll hack the Gibson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Parker -Â— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot youÂ—Â—	If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.	I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Superheroes.	Should I kill them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know somethin', Daddy?	What's that, son?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter with this kid?	I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.	Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ow, shit...	Watch it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Has Sue got it right?	What's that?
You joined up.	Oh, that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.	Gopher, Everett?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir	"Whatta you mean, ""horrible?"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're you guys doing?	Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?	Is this like a trick question?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you going to apologize or not?	Fuck you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's coming!	What?! What is it, a monster?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't she attractive?	Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.	You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?	Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.	But I'll have cocktails with you.
When?	At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.	Okay.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.	Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God!	Climb, Gabe, climb!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.	They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can I do for you, lad?	I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?	About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?	About what you said this morning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick, Alex, how are we today?	How'd you know it was us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe --?	Yes, Bill.
How about giving a guy a break?	Make an exception?
There's one to every rule.	Not this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on!	It's not working!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?	Yes.  Yes, it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it, Evelyn.	I have no choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Her name?	Rebecca Lawson.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?	No -- but I can get it for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?!	The reactor.
What reactor?!	The one in the mine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the hell are you?	It's okay. I know her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.	Good night.
Sleep tight.	Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light.	Dad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zander, what are you doing ?	Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right?	Yeah.
Seat's too high.	My mom says I'm gonna grow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you talkin' about...	...colonel?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.	The man and the woman are married --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Another historical inaccuracy.	Would somebody shut this guy up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baldwin -- his name is.	I give that marriage six months.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My sonÂ—inÂ—law. What do you think of him?	That depends. How much money has he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morgan, Let's go.	I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Water of Life.	The most lethal poison in the Universe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.	We were?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?	Yes.
How do you do.	How do you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we chance moving him?	Please - - chance it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the charge?	You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?	Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you like best about her?	Lunch in a restaurant.
What do you like best about your daddy?	Playing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But where did you finally end up?	It was futile. We went all over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey...	See something you like, my man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	You were gonna ask me weren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??	Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's roll -	Right behind you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yah, that is a nice ass.	You could put a pool in that backyard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A <u>man</u> started the fire.	Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should I say it?	Follow your impulse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a thousand million electron volts.	I knew that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  There's no behavior modification.	She reappeared exactly as she had before?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Missed you, cousin.	Missed you too, cousin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you, Margie.	I love you, Norm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he fixin' to do, ma?	Hush!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"How about a ""Man in Jeopardy"" story?"	Did you change your hair?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't do that?	Do what?
Let you leave without it.	Without what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll be there.	Good, good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, yes.	Yes, indeedy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Knight ...	Black...
... death ...	Love...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't know any way you'll trust me?	Nothing comes to mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
About our secrets.	No.
Why, pray tell?	Because John said I mustn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell?	Yoo hoo, bomb...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's French, though.  It really is.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, my God...	Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.	Don't move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can we do?	We must end the campaign.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what's wrong with it?	It's...gone...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
All dead except one, sir.	Kill the bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, wait, you're from where?	Manhattan.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?	It's a change.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Max.	It's not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you do?	How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.	And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Five.	Twenty!
Ten.	Deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This thing solid?	An elephant couldn't crack it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can hardly wait for your wedding.	Me either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many bullets left, kid?	Not many.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.	What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?	Yes... I think I can manage...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.	Yahoo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hell!	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's none of my business anymore.	I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Range twenty meters.	Seal the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing's going to happen to you.	Nothing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.	All right, five hundred guineas.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.	Hello, Stew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Careful.	I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very nice.	Not a word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kick a buck.	Damn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was all that?	Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?	No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Drowned, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?	Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Turned Czech huh?	Yeah, maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for the promotion, man.	No prob...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Senator Kane.	This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!	The committee is adjourned until further notice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reggie -- why won't you listen?	I'm through listening to you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Nothin'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're breaking my ribs!	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you, Miss?	Fine...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me it's not true.	I can't let you do this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gotta get back to work.	Okay, I'll call you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	It's not the kind of thing you do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.	You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?	Yes and no ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want a drink?	Vodka?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got to go, I'll see you.	Oskar -
<EOC>	<EOC>
He did say something.	What was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who the fuck are you?	Ray Barboni. From Miami.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!	Don't you want a second take, for protection?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey, who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's different for us.	We've always been here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can they do this?	It isn't fair!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You two could play checkers.	Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Neil -- what --	Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Honey --	Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. It's just trying to frighten us.	It's succeeding!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The bear's got his claws back.	Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...	You don't have to wait three days...
...Okay, two...	...just be smart about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, I got some scotch.	Single malt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.	She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	Aristotle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...But I turned in my knee pads.	Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Simpson ...	Yes.
What color is that hedge of yours?	Green.
No, not that hedge. The other one.	The other one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!	We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll never find my way through that.	I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What on Earth are they doing?	Who am I, David Blane?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll know who I am.	We'll change your appearance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's too bad.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There they are!	Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help you?	Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why am I here? What happened?	You...  ...fell into the Bay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going to play it again.	Well, lemme play the other side then.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.	Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?	Bzzzzzzzzzt!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I say we call it quits.	Fine.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Watch how it eats!	Please!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, no problem.	Okay thanks, atta girl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're kidding me.	I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indeed? How interesting.	Yes - isn't it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Liza Sutton is dead.	Then I can't be hurt anymore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think?	Is it me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, now.	Bye, Robert.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam?!	I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.	It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	One last time. Give me the box.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And how much is braces?	It's...doesn't matter....
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is a little nuts.	Turn the tapes back on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The door was locked.	She and Mollie were talking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, school going alright?	Okay, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack, we'd better go.	What do you mean? I'm starving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Er, goodbye, sir.	It has been a pleasure to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?  Where?	Just behind us, over to the right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you love her or something?	Come on...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything is all right, John.	Pick up the hat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did you hurt your hand?	Just an accident. Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was talking to Dad.	I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's just one thing I want to know.	Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doin' Mister D?	Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're the only one I can trust.	The only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, Mason.	Doctor.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?	Okay.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he talking about?	In college. A car accident.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Nielson's?	On your desk.
Script coverage?	On your desk.
Coffee and...	Your desk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this? What color is it?	Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pardon me... Miss... ?	Oh, no... you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.	But your honorÂ—
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Tell me it's not a mirage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me as soon as you get him.	Leave your phone on the hook.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't have any answers for you.	Who was that man last night?
I don't know.	Then how did he know your name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That smells like fresh coffee.	Let me get you a cup?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I believe I can bring him back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello? Computer...?	Just use the keyboard...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's not what I saw.	All right.  If you're positive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know.	You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So can we consider you a regular, sir?	Is that good or bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's harmless.	Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think of the strike, Ali?	I think it'll be a success ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey Cy, guess who's here?	Mary ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.	Well now there's a compliment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...	Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.	Believe you're right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.	Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.	Only the sword will settle this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	This --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Malkovich.	Malkovich!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	My job.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.	My step-father's going to tear you apart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a martini?	No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Close your eyes.	What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.	Why?
To relax.	I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.	Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh.	Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need something. Do you have banking connections?	I have connections.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Back so soon.	Mind your own business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bill --	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Environment.  That's cool with me.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said shut the fuck up --	He believes in the future --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about him?	You wanna go out with him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
--yeah, a hand or something--	--coming out of the water--
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Huh huh huh. He said ""anus."""	Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	What? I didn't hear anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just in time.	Stay the fuck away from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, I'll see you!	Where you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'll you have, Margo?	Martini.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll just say it.	I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.	On your marks...  Get set go.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Green?	Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?	I'm fine. Can I go up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!	Gimme a dollar.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I need a ride.	I'm your man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn. It's doing it again.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to say that.	I want you.  To tell the truth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
with what?	You know damn well, dead-man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Any chance of getting me out on bail?	What is bail?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.	Happy Hanukkah Morty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no?	Oh no.
It's not what I heard.	Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it easy, that's Bill.	Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You just gonna let him go?	We'll get a tail put on him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	I'll be there in three hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stall.	What do you want?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rod says the sweetest things.	He's nuts about you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?	Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -	Don't you remember what they called you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.	Why, honey --
Come on.	You gonna tell me why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.	Him no white.  Him no white.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Count of three?	Why not just go now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't even a man yet.	That ain't what your mama said.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can he breathe under water?	Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.  Fly casual.	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.	What a session this has been.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	That they're going to be upset.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do we find him?	You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ha-ha!!	You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hope is a four-letter word.	But we all need that too. Hold him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep trying.	I'm on it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...she can go up there.	Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.	You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.	Thank god!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You folks ready to go on?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps you could remind me.	I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Merle?	Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell that man not to drive so fast.	Are you talking to me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?  What do you need?	Me?
You just said everyone needs something.	I've got everything I need.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--	--Cotter's--
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, looka here...	Hi, Daddy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Game over, bitch!	Bain!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it a Kappa?	It's not a Theta --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poor Father . . .	Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!	John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yup.	Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?	Yea, James.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Implants bothering you?	It's nothing. I'm just tired.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell happened to you?	Well. I don't really know where to start.
Your hair's different.	Everything's different.
Are you drunk?	No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.	Where's pop?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going to be late for your match.	Are you going to come tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flowers. That's funny.	As long as I get the laugh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't he want to sell it?	I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was it?	Could use a dash more jet fuel.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.	I leave tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
On account of me.	You?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I should probably get going.	No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
No. I --	I know a man who needs a refill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you pose for me for free?	Well, it all depends, Leonard...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You messed with the scene.	Shut up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to dance?	Dance? Here?
Why not?	They know you here--know your name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which presumably means...	... More spores coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.	Any reply from them?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, I have mine.	And I have mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brad...	It's alright Janet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's stopped.	The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You never had The Talk, did you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go into town with you.	Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then leave her.	We can't...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're on the next plane home.	I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure?	Sure.

Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.	Thanks a lot.

<EOC>	<EOC>
DonÂ’t do this, Jack... But he continues...	We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?	I'm...fine.  Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... No response, sir.	Sensors, Captain?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.	Huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been dreaming about this.	Then you get it.  You'll understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...	Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I prefer it like this.	How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're the guys from the movie!	We hate you guys!

<EOC>	<EOC>
And we got rid of the red head.	Jake? Customs?

<EOC>	<EOC>
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!	Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Take it easy, Pop.	Don't start on me today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One more night and you're finally rid of me.	Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you know about my father?	He's a rapist. Like mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.	Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	I thought I saw...
<EOC>	<EOC>

Charlie?	Looks that way.
Who's he?	God knows.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you get a safe shot...	I'll take it!

Good afternoon, Clayton.	Do I look okay?

<EOC>	<EOC>
How's that?	Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	That's life.  What can I tell you?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Leg of lamb this time?	Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This food is excellent.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have the name I wrote down?	Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.	Was he any good?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this place?	Must be the music room.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were getting me a drink?	Just a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.	You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?	Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.	Never heard of 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I lied.	About what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you writing?	Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?	Funny.  Can I phone London?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd rather piss glass.	Well, you got the big gauge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yes, there is.	I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Mine.  Land mine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...	...within five minutes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're never getting out of here.	Shhh...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here...use a spoon.	Leave me alone, Marion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, this works pretty good.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You want some berries?	Hunh?

<EOC>	<EOC>
It's because you don't eat.	I eat.
When?	When nobody's looking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's coming over here...	Heart be still.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!	You fuckin' rule!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mulder...?	What happened to playing a hunch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She already has.	It's alright, isn't it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They have noble faces.	I've always thought that myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell them to take us out.	If there's any chance --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.	No. I don't want to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.	You capitalist pig!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?	I think it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twelve have a mission within the week.	This time I will supervise each test personally.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any theories about last night?	Theories?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!  I'm sick of this...	Nicholas...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything?	All in Norwegian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't gamble.	Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ford, you were right!	Ye-ah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.	What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you get some sleep?	Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.	Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?	I want to see her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's it going?	Maybe I'm going too fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everything's going exactly as we planned.	Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.	Your mind is so slippery.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.	I'm here, ain't I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.	Good morning, sir.

<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to take this slow...	Right, slow...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you love me?	Do you love me?
I asked first.	Sometimes I think I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You better dust this place, Sam.	I'll get my kit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And it is guarded by sixty men.	And our assets?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Clenched jaw...	Will you stop RIDING ME?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miller, do you read me, Peters --	Get them back --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Lip reading.
What are they saying?	Nothing good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's like the basketball team.	The basketball team?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was bad.	Bad?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you at the wedding.	You bet ya, Coach.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Communicate?	Tell you my secrets.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mind if I turn on some heat?	If you can figure it out, be my guest.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Working late.  You're a damn fool.	Oh, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way, no day!	Give it up girl!

Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll show you it works.	What the hell is going on here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.	Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.	See ya tomorrow.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ask me?	Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your mother wants to hear from you --	GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So?	So, we need to get to the source.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.	Want me to carry Elora?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye!  Goodbye!	So how'd we do?

<EOC>	<EOC>
I CAN GET HIM!	NO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute - let me out.	Well, there's not much time.

<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When does George get to come see his house?	It's so beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is this? This is water?	It's a mouse trap.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry. You've lost me...	I'm asking what you're here for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two down, four to go.	What's that supposed to mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So he knows your name?	I told him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes --	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why we sittin' here, mama?	Thinkin' a second, baby.

Where to first?	The House of Pain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Agatha --	Can you see the balloon man?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.	Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?

I was in the middle of --	-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then I'm sure to get a brain --	A heart --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you got a better idea?	I just don't want to go.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Let go -- he can't -- !	Only half of you would get there.

You don't believe that.	Hardly ever.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.	It does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because he dated her.	How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.	Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right.	I'm proud of you, Vincent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've eaten.	Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I just wanted to know where Mom was?	Oh.  Sorry.
It's okay.	She needs to be alone, I think.
Because Dad left?	She's a little sad, is all.

Man, this guy is really good.	He looks like my uncle.

What were you like when you were younger?	Trouble. Why?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?	I had a temper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello!	Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?	It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?	Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.

I'll be all right, Michael.	Good.  So will I....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit! Holy shit.	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Sorry, Mr. Gekko.	Allright. Wait here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
SHUT UP, BILLY!	WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't want to be friends anymore.	Fine.
Beautiful.	We still having dinner in L.A.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One kilometer	Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>

I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.	I don't know what you could have read.
Just what you've published.	-- In magazines nobody reads.
I read the one about the penal colony.	Did you?

He'll never make it.	Think positive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Carl, what are you doing?	You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Can't we --	Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.	There should be an access hatch nearby...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where am I at, man?	C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Women miscarry all the--	--no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what seems to be the problem?	It's the game, ARCADE.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course.  You must be so proud.	I am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think of America?	It is beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it back, Freb --	Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

<EOC>	<EOC>
Ninety-three miles an hour.	He looks wonderful, Jackson...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You grew up around here?	Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?	Pretty boring, I guess.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.	Have they sat down?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?	Harrington.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They switched us over.	To what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is going to do nothing.	We have to go in the basement.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Laurie...	Hi, Tommy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could stay here forever...	I donÂ’t think IÂ’d fight you on that one...
<EOC>	<EOC>
She wants to quit?	She can't quit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But would you--would you--	Have really held you under?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think that's funny	No.

Good marrow, father!	Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.	Any time, sailor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I never saw him before.	What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.	What's that to you?
Nothing.	What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.	I'm asking you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guy's a spook!	"Yeah, but for who?							*"
<EOC>	<EOC>
God, she's beautiful.	Victoria? She's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Worst day of my life, man.	Well, I'm sold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you get here?	I hitched.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.	My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"If you've got ""a broad"" available I'll take her."	Like you'd know what to do with one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well--goodnight.	Goodnight, Jeff.

Great.  Can I have it then?	No, you can't.

That's where a lead bullet has torn you.	And this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It feels warm.	One more shot?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?	Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn...damn...damn...	Hey, are you okay?
No...IÂ’m not...	Is there anything I can do for you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said I think it is.	All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.	Elaine -- I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What were you dreaming about?	A voice ...
That spoke to you?	That called ... commanded ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?	Get outta here.

How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?	I'm not telling you what happened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time is it?	Two thirty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you taking us now?	Home.

When's your show?	Not sure. How was yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's in a case, on his desk.	Does the case lock?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you bitching about now?	What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.	Your stuff?  Let me see that.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you crying?	I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.	A black bull came.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.	He's in it with Willis?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What??	Oh my, no!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought he was carrying something.	But not a knife?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how are you really doing, Panes?	Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.	I'm worried about your Galiano.

You ever see a palm tree, Homer?	He ain't never been outta Maine!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.	You couldn't.
I do.	It's just like my grandmother's china.

No beauty...	Just the beast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kelly.  What is it?	I miss Dad.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...	No you don't.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, I should be getting...	...It's really getting late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scream.	During sex.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I didn't kill anybody.	Then who did? You're the only one left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Load of bullshit.	We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't trust him.	Kill him when he gets down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.	We're already two settings below that, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah? Who is it?	It's me, honey. It's Mom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!	I'll talk to you later.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have a wonderful new play!	Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.	Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!	And his ears.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!	Partners!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's the wrong way!	Detour.  Other way's blocked...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't even want to touch me.	Yes. Yes, I do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Could you fill me in?	Why don't you ask your chief detective?
<EOC>	<EOC>
More endearments.	I like you, DIl
Love me.	Yes.
Tell me you love me.	Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.	Love you, Dil.
You do?	Yeah.
What would you do for me?	Anything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...	...It looked money.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah. You?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you coming?	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We know what's going on.	I still don't know what you're talking about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lie face down on the floor.	What?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you alright?	Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could've sworn I heard something.	Door's locked. Nothing there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?	If that's what it takes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ask what room he's in, okay?	Buona notte.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could use a shower.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten is standard, sir.	Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our life in a nutshell...	If you want to look at it that way...
<EOC>	<EOC>
President vetoes works bill?	We vetoed that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?	Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?	Oh, yes, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ippolito!  Get back here!	Like hell!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're not finished yet --	You wanna bet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gay.	Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.	You're lying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't going to work.	Why didn't you say so before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.	That sounds pretty interesting...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, Otis?	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where?	Down there in the Park.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.	Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's jammed the mechanism.	Now what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you ready?	Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.	We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Uh-huh	And I'll have the special fish.

<EOC>	<EOC>
There was not much blood, was there?	I didn't see none.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.	Okay.  You behave yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a ladder here.	My hero.  Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zit cream?	I wish.
Neosporin?	Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.	That was Thursday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You provoke me, Merlin.	What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?	That wasn't me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Sketchy--	We gotta talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.	Coordinate what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about one now?	Sounds good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A new car. We can't afford a new car.	Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd better get you to a hospital.	I'll be okay, just get me home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't get around us that easy!	Not nohow!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hair stuff?	I gotta go to work.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Comin' out here, Boss?	Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So you dropped by to apologize?	Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what we're facing.	I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why'd they decide to move?	Too hot in the lighthouse?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Starting now, we attack them.	How; we don't know where they are?

Sid, I'll come with you.	But who would operate your camera?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't really believe she's innocent?	Of course, I do!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Strange to be calling yourself.	Maybe it's not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aye sir, coding now.	Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell is that?	The engines!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not going anywhere.	Watch me.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello--	You ready?

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Oh, PeterÂ—
What's got into you?	Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They were Hebrew, weren't they?	That's right.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.	Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?	I told you we don't know for certain.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the next street.	I know where it is.
Turn left.	I know where to turn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Methuselah Syndrome.	What's that?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.	Is that why you're still here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.	No further questions.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jackie Shawn.	-- yeah, this is --

You like that?	Very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?	You were little Jesse James when you left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.	The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could be worse than the old series.	In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What would you do in my place?	Me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a miracle!!!	What is?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Please don't wash your hands in the sink.	Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.	What's the difference...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.	It's a container.  Break the seal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
One hundred and twenty-seven.	How much do you think you'll need?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the arm?	It's nothing to worry about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's not!  He's not!	Who's not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, Available?	Please... No.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
What's the password?	Uhh... I don't know.
Guess.	Uhh... Bacon.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is not a dream! This is my life.	Of course it is. What else could it be?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't do it -- Nick!	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.	I was so scared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The red hair... It's bad luck.	It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! Don't harm the vessel!	It's Craig in there, I can tell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, great.	Yeah, that was easy.
Do you do washing machines, too?	Just show me the way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!	I am the crane, agile and sublime!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, beautiful.	Jesus!  Don't do that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you pay some attention to me?	Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!	You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!	Well, he's a gentleman!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We spent it!	Ha. Ha.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello Wade.	Out of the room.

Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh-huh.	He stayed a long time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Smells like dirt.	You get used to it.
When?	You want to go back in?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was in Chinatown.	What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.	Doing what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, SHIT!	Hey, hey, it's just me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.	Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
<EOC>	<EOC>
ItÃ­s extremely important to my investigation...	IÃ­ll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vox?	This way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...ixed itself.	Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.	He's tampered with it, Dowser.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This place is built like a fortress.	Because that's what it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We had a bargain.  You promised.	I lied.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you break a cup, Jack?	Eddie did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't to that...	Wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heather Langenkamp?	Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.	Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.	You could pick that scab on your arm.
It's a mosquito bite.	It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?	Uh huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!	Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was close....	Anna, I think you better stay....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or a big mother slug maybe?	Some kind of mutation...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will the lady say?	She won't even know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Very funny...	Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eeuch !	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.	As brave as my father. As wise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Casey! Casey!	Not my daughter... not my...
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm off.	Wish you weren't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good shooting, Danny!	Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...	Home of the brave!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?	We weren't sure we could trust you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George --	I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!	I didn't come here to be insulted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.	Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
<EOC>	<EOC>
People...  after me.	Who?
I don't know who they are.	Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.	Don't know much, do you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a no go, Joe.	Marylin!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She was a good woman.	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...are followin' him around.	Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's innocent.	Aren't they all?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What kind of car was it?	What?
Do you remember the make of the car?	Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.	It was a Ford, Benjamin.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!	That's enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can we do?	Oh, several things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Such power exists?	I assure you such power exists.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I bet you have a great family.	You know, nothing special.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?	Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.	Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
How many?	You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Impossible. Put it on again.	Hey, make up your mind, will you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something I ought to tell you.	Tell me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.	Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.	I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.	You think that's wise?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I do sort of live with somebody though.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.	Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And more importantly --	I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.	I did, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...	We have met ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
My wife? What's she got to do with you?	No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Monsters in the gelatin...	It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...	Oh, man --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You?	That's right, me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want you to give up your work....	Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....	I'm not going to quit now....
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't love you any more.	Just like that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do we go now?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He cribbed that from Borges.	It beats 'What's your major?'
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.	Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!	It's in New Jersey.
New York.	I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.	Oh, I didn't know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is bad.	The gas tank's going to go any second!
<EOC>	<EOC>
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.	I don't know. Something's missing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I really don't have much of an appetite.	Just wait.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.	Incredible.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.	Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.	Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine, then how many nights home is that?	Keep your voice down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're not usually graduate students.	SWAT wants to go in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.	Yes it does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How many in their party?	Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.	Gotta go?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wake up.	Is he dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want children.	You've just decided, is that right?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You all right now?	Yeah.
You coming to South America?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you think?	I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus, we're trapped!	Ju...
<EOC>	<EOC>
'N turned into a frog -	He was never turned into a frog!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't serve formula. Snookums.	You serve martinis, doncha?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are!	This doesn't obligate me in any way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?	You're joking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I say I've got it.	Sir?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.	Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.	Goodnight, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes? You're dressed...okay.	You didn't give them a name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do we have here, Margaret?	It's a tampon in a teacup...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.	The sentences to run concurrently.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir, we're being hailed.	On screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Old Macdonald... had --"""	"""-- an AXE!"""
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here we are.	Well, son, you're home!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good. You've both been working close to the front.	Never this close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What... what are you doing?	Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want to go home?	I don't have one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't say I was good at it.	Oh shit! There he is!
<EOC>	<EOC>
My condolences.	Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.	A neighbor saw your car leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So. Do you have a name?	It's Esther.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you live?	In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Then maybe IÂ’d be... open to that.	Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...	I could come for a second opinion?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going inside.	What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...	Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on. He's a crook.	What crook?
<EOC>	<EOC>
About Michael's job.	Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.	Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!	Out here.  On your knees.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.	Just until he heals up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.	Shhhh. Shhhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.	Nice of you to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What will happen to the others?	"They are not babies, Maria, merely ""human possibilities""."
<EOC>	<EOC>
Neither.	Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Like you used to be?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what else has Superman got?	He's got the fact that he's Superman!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you know what that is?	Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?	Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about we go somewhere else?	Want to see my raft?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell...	They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think so--	Well--
<EOC>	<EOC>
No questions.	You may call your next witness.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.	How come you're not eating?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still makin' jokes?	No joke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn.	INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/STAIRWELL - DAY.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have someone I want you to meet.	I'll be right there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.	That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I feel a scene coming on.	Is it about a pirate's daughter?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.	How's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How old are you?	I'm eleven and a half.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...	Then we cannot go.
Because...?	Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?	Everything still checks out okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I buy companies.	No shit.  They expensive?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is my permiso.	Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vada? VADA?? What happened??	My ball, I lost my ball.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes!	I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Freddy, for all I know.	Steady...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What-are they speaking?	Russian, I think. I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!	I knew you'd like him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There is nothing.	Reach out farther. Call to her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- Burn them.	And old ladies?
-- Burn them.	And the world -- the whole world.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...leaving tomorrow, sir.	Excuse me, have you got tooth...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.  You done this before?	Plenty of times.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well -- I --	And you can't tell me who you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not leaving tomorrow..?	I think not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Laura. What's wrong this morning?	Stay away from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! Where'd you guys go?	Left, goddamnit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
- end where I began.	Maude.
Yes.	Here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have all -- what?	Night. I'm going to stay with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Suppose you listen just for a minute -	Madame is waiting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.	Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Donny --	Donny-nothin'!
<EOC>	<EOC>
People can see.	And that would ruin your reputation how?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up? Jess ready?	You driving her?
Yeah.	She'll be out in a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, may we have a look around?	Please, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was just asking...	Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You talked to New York?	Yes
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought everything WAS arranged.	Well, there's a problem.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't know anything about it	Well, it's off ration. We know that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what he said, is it?	Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
His profession?	Well, he worked around.
And his age?	I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?	No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.	Okay, thanks very much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!	Progress! It always arrives too late!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Morning!	Erin?  What are you --
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's totally cut off from the outer world.	How long does it last?  Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It might show.	Mike wants it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Emily?	Your wife.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.	Perfect. Well then, shall we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me your name.	Ann Bishop Millaney.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...	Have him peel the top label back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't bother asking, we already tried.	It's so very nice to see you again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not millions.	He's directing now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is she?	Swann's wife.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were talking in your sleep.	What'd I say?
"""Hey, yourself."""	Huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me --	Annabelle let's get something clear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.
How's she doing?	Okay. She's fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not armed.	But you're not alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?	Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.	Not so bad yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you have sex before you were married?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?	It's fantastic -- it's too much.
"It's the car she drove in ""Eternity Forever""."	I know.  Thank her for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?	That's not her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they suffering?	They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the goddamn car?	You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What IS working around here?	Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
That's it?	Best we could do in two hours.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something happened, didn't it?	Yes, it did.
Are you wigging out?	Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?	No, we're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I better go.	I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why -- good morning, Squire.	Morning, Jabez.
<EOC>	<EOC>
DON'T!	YOU'LL HIT US!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like a hand?	When your ready Son!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I promise.	Scott?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's your son.	Okay, boy, beat it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?	That's my morning's pay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Romirez understood.  Not you.	Romirez is dust.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.	I'm sure we will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Track their weapons fire.	Western hemisphere... North American continent...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>
"How... was she ""called?"""	Pardon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But she ran away.	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I fall asleep at the wheel.	I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And that's how I ended up here.	And the head?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kelly.	Kevin, hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.	You too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?	Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.	Hi ho, Silver.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.	Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That ain't no happy child.	He tortures toys -- just for fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Torpedo room--?	Uhura, monitor!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is he in love with you?	I don't know Â—-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!	How the fuck should I know!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, my Lord.	We are alone...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does Kat know?	Jeffrey told her last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You didn't tell David?	No.  Just you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They found the safe.	You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.	I will.  Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Taffey Lewis?	Yes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yes, I think so.	Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We ain't got all fuckin' day!	Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
<EOC>	<EOC>
As soon as possible.	Jack...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see who that was?	Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
He is just wonderful.	I'1l get your bag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ride like wild fire, Jack.	He'll not escape me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?	My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here, in case you think of any ideas.	Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what do you think?	I'd cut it...
You would?	Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.	No, I'm sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	I don't want to talk about this here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Our answer.	To what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much weight have you lost?	Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
You hate to swim.	People change.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Will you stay with me till they get here?	Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dispatch, this is Reilly.	Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.	Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.	Hang on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can still take the offer, Rod.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, L.A.	Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that an offer?	It is not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who's she talking to?	That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's beautiful. Thank you.	I hope it brings you luck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You mentioned that in your letters	I always thought you'd follow me up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did we make it?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Carlsons' are here.	They are?  Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.	Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.	Where are you from?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.	Well thanks!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Everyone seems so--	Jittery is the word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Thanksgiving.	To you, to me it's Thursday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
As good as Hopkins?	Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ever do that again.	I thought I saw a black widow spider.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...	Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, what?	Don't answer me. Say what I say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your breasts feel larger.	They do? Oh no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you for saving my life.	That's what they pay me for.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.	Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I figured you might like some help.	Yeah?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think this is a fucking joke?	$1,000,000.
<EOC>	<EOC>
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?	If you persist, you leave us no choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's right.	Isn't it a little late?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Jean Luc.	Why am I here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It looks just like a regular Mustang --	Don't go there, Toby --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are they singing, Mama?	They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?	Yes. We will light the candles.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.	Honest?

We're going up the tower, Madeleine.	No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.	You can't. You're afraid!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your words, not mine...	You speak for me, son.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?	I do okay.  How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.	I noticed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
PARRTYY!	We're friends of Beckett's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock!	The ship -- out of danger?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can't just...	Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dea ex machina...	What did you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who told you that?	He video taped you.

<EOC>	<EOC>
How was your game?	Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Still the man.	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice.	Hm?  Oh, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I came to see Rachel Lapp.	Try the house.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...	...des raisins de MadÃ¨re, des framboises...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Your new chair, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...	I'm already married ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did you call me, Mayo?	Zack, don't!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have you been staying here?	A couple of months.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You go first.	All right. This morning --
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're my friend, aren't you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, he's real abstract and different.	I'm cute, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What time do you have to stay till?	He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?	Go open the sore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Each to his fate.	Each to his fate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?	And she got the medium.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Frances, got a minute?	Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or a man's mentality.	How do you gut someone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, it is.	It better be worth it for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	This will relax her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So.	So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, man, gimme some skin.	Shorty, this is Laura.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Stop her Louis!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's so cruel.	No. He had the choice.
What choice!!?	Either fight the way things are or accept it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.	He needs help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.	"...""ignition propensity?""  ...you understand any of this...?"

<EOC>	<EOC>
Go ahead!	You go first! There's no time!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are these?	Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.	With pleasure, Madame!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Annie, I think we should have a toast.	A toast?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Explain, act crazy?	Curse and stuff.
I'm not going to curse.	You don't mean it. It's just for show.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.	Just make noises then.
Explain noises.	Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.	You want him coming in the house next time?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can put it anywhere.	Even there?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mrs. Peel?	What kept you?

Yeah.  We did it.	So we did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Diet Coke.	I want a shot of tequila too.

<EOC>	<EOC>
But she still might call!	Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.	Not a chance!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What are you talking about? Where?	It's in my room!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've...	In the car.

<EOC>	<EOC>
In my bed.	Your bed?
<EOC>	<EOC>
See, ya.	Why doesn't it never work out?
What?	Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
History.	Huh?
My father proposed to my mother in there.	No kidding?
<EOC>	<EOC>

A place you've never been.	That's the physicist's playground.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	The quiet...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.	Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?	You married?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you think you should call a backup?	No, we can handle this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, Paul, 'til first light.	Dawn. Then they go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have a room?	Will you be spending more than a night?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's a woman shot in a car?	Yes.  I have to go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enough?	Never enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..	Nyah still on the property?

<EOC>	<EOC>

In his lab.  He won't let you in.	He'll let me in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I... disturbing you?	No.  Come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got you covered.	That's reassuring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.	C'mon. Middle appendix --
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything wrong?	No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?	OK. But late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Snoop onto them...	...as they snoop onto us.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's in there, David!?	Sausage and hambones!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's what he told you, huh?	No, he showed me one.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
You said something was strange. What's strange?	The footprints.
What about them?	There are none.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, okay, let's talk.	In Breslau.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know how I feel?	My mind's not on guessing games.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna miss you.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Home.	Home, that's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Supper for two.	Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.	Oh, Harold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To the Brick Kremlin!	She'll never forgive me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Jack Dawson.	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	Hi. What's in the case?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	Yes, what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.	Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a little game later?	Fine--I'll be glad to.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?	Get out of here!

<EOC>	<EOC>
What about them?	I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?	You don't know what a shortcut is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.	Leave him!
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.	No I haven't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't need a shrink.	Harvey says he's amazing.
Norman...	What can it hurt to talk to someone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	It looks....foreign.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?	He's up with your father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?	Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?	Pray you, undo this button.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.	I'm going to scream!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She said Michael.	What did she mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are they?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You better have that looked at.	Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, is the vault open?	I can take care of that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This time it's for real?	Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey look!	This is a totally barbaric custom.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'l take months.	So we better get started.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!	Grab hold!...
<EOC>	<EOC>
OPEN THE DOOR.	I'm coming!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh don't start that again --	LOOK!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hello Sidney.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are you doing here?	Why, what's up?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you want to stop?	I'm exhausted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you going to thank me?	What's it about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're carrying weight.	We'll take your supercargo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was great.	It sure was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.	We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.	You got a deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
May I?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
November.  '71.	First night?
Day.  Wednesday.	Last?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night, then.	Good night.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like me?	Yes, I like you.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?	You think you're my sister?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?	Fine Fidget. What's all this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Will!	Yes, some of it is speakable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"How did you know it was ""carefully""?"	Frank told me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But...	Pull over.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evening, Luke.	Evening, Doctor Lardner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, so now you think you know me?	I'm gettin' there
<EOC>	<EOC>

Bob?	Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	What?  What's okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me move him.	Careful. Check his pulse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Or your fucking wife, you know.	Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you crazy?	What?
People can see this.	So?
These are private -- these are for us.	I know.
But other people can see them too.	I don't care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have an unusual hand.	I could have told you that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He won't come.	He will. I know he will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?	That's enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was waiting for that jack.	I had a feeling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	I don't mind.
You should go home.	Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.	Will I see you again?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?	Oh, all the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he say?	Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
... Showers followed by sunny periods.	We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Ray --	I'm Peter --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	I think so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The corner!  Ready?	Do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get to the ship!	Come back here... Where are you going?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Fifty cents admission.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you in a bad mood?	I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to stop doing that!	I'll work on it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.	He'll slow down.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I ahh, better go.	It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.	Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't let you take her out.	You can't stop me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll all fry.	This wasn't in the plan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Comfortable?	As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a drink?	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Time from my mark...	Two minutes, ten seconds.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay?	Okay, okay.  I think.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you hate me?	What?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?	Don't talk.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow!	What just happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, man.	No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.	Look at that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hola, Juanito	Hola, bienvenido

Is it dry?	Yeah seems okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I ask you a question?	Sure.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?	I...I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.	Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.	Didn't even buy me a drink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You promised me flowers.	What?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?	Sorry... I was distracted.
Well there's something new.	I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.	Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You lie.	I would never!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's too late...	It's NOT too late!

<EOC>	<EOC>
Please don't.	It's not a bother.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't think it's even an issue.	We're safe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.	You'll acquire a taste for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I call the police, sir?	No!  What do you want!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
For what?	Who you think got your ass outta jail?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.	It is. I did it cooking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --	I don't be-leeve this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Happy Birthday, Bill.	Thank you.

We're getting close...	What's that smell?
Ocean air!	Smells like something died.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.	It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god.	What?
You just burned the desk.	What's happening?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Hi Enid.	Hey Josh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	Roger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?	No. What happened?

<EOC>	<EOC>
C-4?	More bang for the buck.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, get away, get away from me...	Wyatt...

Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.	Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on Rachel.	In a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.	Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told you I'd come back.	You did?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They let you out?	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Miss Daniels? Is that you?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me too. Sounds swell.	Really? It seems so fattening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's Doctor McCoy?	Indisposed, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me live until I die?	I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?	Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Vince knows you're here.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He wasn't a lonely man, though.	What makes you think so?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	...Rene...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.	I'll take care of the Boss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?	What's he do now, tell fortunes?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Still after Jimmy?	They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, did - did you see that?	Oh - look out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Where is Reed</u>?	Victor must've taken him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey, just leave it.	No, there's...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why no silencer?	You want it to be an event.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm soaked.  Oh great.	Shhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...and unharmed, de-...	...-spite the mouth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ever think back to how you started.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.	Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Laurie, you come with us...	No! Do as I say.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you please repeat the destination?	Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?!	Oh, God.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got Bank Americard?	What now, Sonny?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey you.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Mr. Martins?	Never.
<EOC>	<EOC>
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!	That's sick, Dante.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this?	Get out of here, you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Detective Bedsoe.	Lieutenant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me the bat.	Go away from me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have to call the police...	Please, hurry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not Nick Mason...	I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...	Yes!
So you could get with my sister.	Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jus' take it slow, buddy.	What happened? How far did you get?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kevin left without you.	I don't know what you're talking about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is that girl, anyway?	Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	And here are my mother and father.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quit. He's too good.	Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And she's a knock-out, too.	Well, good.  Good for you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It works.	Still gonna smell it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damn him.	What's wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	What do you want?
I want it back.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you <u>real</u> mad?	How could I be?  We learned some magic...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's impossible...	My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What day is it?	It's Friday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you want company...	Just check out the car.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on here?	What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.	Me too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are we doing?	Homework assignment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He can't do that to me.	How can one man possibly be so selfish?
<EOC>	<EOC>
To shave your chest?	We should take a vacation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you threatening me?	I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is my stop.	I'm amused.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mookie.	What?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?	Ask Sal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She must make a glaive.	Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.	Every day.  More and more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Milo? I'm Danny.	Oh hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're an ambitious man.	I hope not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Adam, where are you?	What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.	What did you say?
They fired everyone.	Who fired everyone?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Louise, is that you?	Thelma?  It's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're dead.  Jim's dead.	Take off your coat.
What?	Take off your God damn coat!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?	Who - me? No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--	Never better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's going on?	Nothing...I just spilled something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got one condition.	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He said what?	"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."
No one else heard it?	He whispered it in my ear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you goin' to do?	Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doc eat already?	The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean? His girlfriend?	Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?	Shit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is he acting so strangely?	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claudette...	Somebody'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My father's house.	Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Second safety.	Seond safety.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Joe, don't do this --	It's time to put this person where he belongs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did he talk to you about?	He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?	Why, yes.  Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on, ask them.	You ask them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your watch.	Is it real?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pouring myself into my work.	I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know you.	You know my back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't interfere.	You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long do we have?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bye Aunt Rose.	Bye Niece, Vada.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course I saw it.	Did you see the winning run score?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.	I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?	Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.	That was Mr. Kennedy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's get the hell outta here.	Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is your first name?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's me.
I'm kind of busy.	Please open the door, Danny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I got it.	It's on the college.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You love him?	I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?	More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?	He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Folks came.	Folks come. Folks go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?	Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The both of them?  In there?	He called her.
Oh. So what's it doing here?	Long story.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go after him!!	Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.	Don't have to tell me twice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dr. Grey.	Senator?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you hungry?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It died for your sins.	This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.	Lest we forget how cruel you are.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We will, old fried, we will.	Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?	If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
He's dead Sheila.	I feel sick.
You should.	Are you sure he's dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?	Something... in the trees...
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're going to get help.	We gotta try.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't do it!	Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We lost.	it's okay..

Do you like the way I look?	Yes.
Do you think I'm pretty?	Yes.
Prettier than Ann?	Different.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?	Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's your star?	Gosh, you look nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.	Come on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There.  All done.  Lift me down.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something's wrong.	Look!  Sarah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Engaged.	Let's take her into an escape orbit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was devastated. Of course.	Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's go.	Move out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This your stuff?	That's it.  My life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you done?	What have I done?! Idiots.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's in back.	Thanks.
How was huntin'?	Oh. Fine.
Get anything?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's that?	Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You smell so good.	You have to give yourself up, you know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
0 my god.	Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.	Except us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Buffy!  Looking tasty.	Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah baby. Everything's great.	Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.	Now?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Should be here any minute.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we can get in by the top.	You want to try?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know it's a dream.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wait a minute!  Let go there!	Murder, uh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?  A handkerchief?	It's nothing ... nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Coffee?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm talking to you, Tita!	Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.	Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?  What happened?	Tommy, what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One shot -- for emergencies.	That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.	If you say so.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-no Cheesy Poofs.	-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
D'Amour --	Shit...

<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.	John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.	Got a handkerchief?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They announced it?	Yah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where the hell you goin'?	I'm going with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good night.	Good night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what?	There's the fence...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll send it to you at Glades.	Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you tell me?	She's making it up! My father was Professor --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.	They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  I heard screaming...	Luke.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He's drunk.	Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't ask me in.	Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.	I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.	Don't be cruel.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.	Only if you kiss me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They'll kill us!	You want some punch?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must be my son.	Shake hands with your daddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't do it, Norman!	Do you see it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you'd be at the dinner.	It's too loud for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Heading back?	Might as well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Minh...	Yep...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you thinking?	You gotta admire the man's determination.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you want us?	Up there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<u>Stop</u>...	That's what I said.
How are you getting on with these fine people?	Like dykes and dogs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...There's a start for a meeting.	I know it's none of my business --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck!	You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!	I'll pay for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I -- lost something.	It wouldn't happen to be this...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?	Then we'll be right where we are now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, come on now - everybody --	Did you just hear what I just heard?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.	Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?	Yes, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck.	You, too. Kick ass today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're beautiful.	So are you!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like weather.	Yep.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Damone, are you there?	I'm really pretty busy...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	And now for that twentieth crackÂ—
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.	What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.	How long since your last confession, my son?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!	Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a drink?	I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?	Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It means a lot that you came by.	Yes, we appreciate that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"""Mas cerveza por favor."""	That Buddy was a cool breeze.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're on fire!	Not this again --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bad news?	Look for yourselves.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Every week --	I'm dying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are they going to work here too?	Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.	We have a situation. The members are assembling.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You remember Miriam....	Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The flamethrower!	I can't, the acid will pour out!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Does this offer include my partner?	Only if he can be trusted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And you say all them people is dead now?	That's right--
<EOC>	<EOC>
...what happened...?	I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- very nice, very nice.	-- mmm --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bathroom?	Round back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's alright.	It is?
It will be fine. You have another.	Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.	I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.	Tear it apart?
Yes.	Ahhh...Okay?!!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have to get these wet things off.	You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Confirm with trig and image.	Any ID on the shooter yet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?	<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<EOC>	<EOC>
You, too?	He invited me to his house last night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?	He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.	You ever play Chicken?
What's that?	You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.	Well, a boy goes like this, see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, I just...	Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If she's not up, you can use my shower.	Thank you.
You're here early today.	We're getting out of the ground today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?	Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you believe me?	Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are incredible...	Enjoy it, sweetheart...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me?	I said take off your fucking shirt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
KILL! KILL!	Stop it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are we...?	Are we what, Jack?
<EOC>	<EOC>
One, up.	Lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't think we survived the crash.	This is going to take some time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this the same stuff you made last week?	No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.	It tastes different.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think they'll come out now.	They still seem nervous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?	Moffo!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got him.	Alice, I...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Ray, time to go!	I'm stuck!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why... her?	Her body pleases me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spangler says we have a relationship.	What?
You and I -- a relationship.	I was wondering what that was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course not.	Then who's it for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.	Goodbye, Mary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	Flesh wound.  No big deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, just like the President.	Just like the President.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What exactly do you do?	Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could go for a Whopper.	"Let's hit ""Kelly's."""
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll get the boots.	Get the boots.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wanted to get this out of the way.	You got a bet on the game tonight?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You excited?	I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.	Why you think is today?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How're we doing?	Better than we thought.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.	Da pleasure be mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not funny, huh?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?	Zach from work ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was a great night.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're not gonna kill me?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why'd you do it, Armitage?	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nix! Nix!	Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!	And he's dead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fine.	What do you want on it?
You.	Would you settle for pepperoni?

I'll go. It's my fault.	You said it, not me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.	I heard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm so sorry.	Please, don't do that...
<EOC>	<EOC>

Why not?	Cuz nothing happened at school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now what's wrong?	I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?	I'm trying.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here.	Aren't you going to have one?
No.	Why not?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.	Shut your hole, Slutnik.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No!	It bit me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.	And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Glad to meet you, Winifred.	Nice to meet you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Take it slowly.	So damn stupid.
You're done worse.	I'll be scarred for life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yoda, I must know.	Your father he is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pike and I got separated --	Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --	Oh, you remember now --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nervous?	Excited.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd you know my name was Jack?	"I call all you white guys ""Jack."""
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
May I see your license?	Why?

<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that??	Hostage negotiations.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Beautiful place...

We got a problem here, brother?	Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
McKinney's the name.	Miss Marsh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were good.	Real good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enjoying the tour so far?	Are you going to kill us?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my god, I thought--	I'd taken the Mask?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think of that, Jabez?	Looks right elegant, Mary.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, what do you want to do?	I think I've studied enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.	No, thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got the permit.	Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.	He's got a gift for fiction.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know?	He didn't wear bifocals.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It'd make their heads explode.	Millionaires, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pick those up, Reno.	I didn't drop 'em.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?	I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get some sleep.	You have to sleep for three.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you okay?	Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?

<EOC>	<EOC>
First finish your tea...	He doesn't need to...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh . . . my . . .	Clark. . . !
<EOC>	<EOC>
That'd be my guess.	So whoever did this might still be around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me go into the church alone.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope you enjoyed your visit.	Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.	They seemed, closing by much
Tony and China?	Vell.  Goodnight.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
But it's clean?	All right then we've got clean rats.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You done with your small talk?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry.	It's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...	That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
That's right...	...take <u>any</u> two people...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What have you been doing?	Uh....old badminton injury.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you love me?	Of course.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks. See man?	You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.	I don't need sleep!
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.	Screw you too, Kitty.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Sweet Dick Willie.	That's my name.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you still a virgin?	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
<EOC>	<EOC>
More than enough.	Have you thought at all about your plans?

Say something it's too quiet.	Umm, Ummmmm

<EOC>	<EOC>
Drive!  Drive away!	What happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, but I have my own now.	You went out this morning and bought a gun?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's funny.	How's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wanna drink.	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	I don't know.  It just went dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claire?	Three o'clock.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
<EOC>	<EOC>
And how is Lord Lavenham?	...and little Lady Beatrice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you leave us alone right now?	I love her too, Joe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you crazy!?	Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I play roller hockey?	We'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I made it go down the toilet.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He comes over to study.	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He hasn't had breakfast yet.	Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not a charade, all this?	A charade?  How could it be a charade?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...you wearing a watch, Father?	Yes.  It's exactly...
<EOC>	<EOC>
...What's going on with you two?	All right...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was impressed.	Oh?
The charades.	Thank you.
That was my clue.	Oh?
The Shostakovich.	Really??
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were burned by some organic acid.	I'm lucky that way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.	We gotta get out of here. Now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-	I never played Fort Sumter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was... something meeting you.	Likewise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I said...	...I'm not deaf, y'know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Objection.  You're leading the witness.	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
My Mom's at that.	Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This one. I think he's in here.	How do you know?
<EOC>	<EOC>
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?	Give it to him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's you...Irena...my friend!	Don't cry, Amy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	Survival.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.	I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.	Piece of cake, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Much less go outside.	Then Captain Amazing appeared.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good-bye, Frankie.	'Got a good thing, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I understand.	Here it is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.  Kay?	How is your father?
He'll be OK.	I love you.

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	All right everybody, hold up!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want a drink?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I have another one?	I guess it wouldn't hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where're we going?	Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.	Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...

Got 'cha!	HOLD THAT TIGHT!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You wanna split?	Yeah, I don't feel so well.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flynn...  Where's Ram?	I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please answer my question.	You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.	It is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something bothering you?	Nothing. Let's just go fight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This could Pbe it.	This could be it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just how serious is it, doctor?	Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mama said you was hit by a train!	Blooey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!	Don't get all sappy about it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What day is this?	Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?	Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...	I can't imagine why.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't ...	Thou must.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well... where is he?	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow. That shirt is working hard.	Is Vanessa here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shields, Mr. Chekov.	Shields, aye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm home now.	Yes -- but ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Alonzo...
Stevens?	Something's wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You stay with me.	Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.	After you, ma'am.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I think we really do understand one another.	Right... Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	...Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go home.	OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You coming?	In a minute. Get us a table.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can feel air.	Me too.
It's getting stronger.	I'm close.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...please...	Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It was very dark.	Yes it was.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There goes the neighborhood.	A real shame.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	Nowhere...
<EOC>	<EOC>
The fare is eighteen credits, please.	Quit while you're ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really liked it?	At the end of every chapter --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whuhh...	Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's something else, too.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...my... home?	Yes, John.
You did this for me?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right.	So what's the argument?
No argument.	Oh Christ. Julia...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is anything missing?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She'll tell them everything...	I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.	Maybe.
Don't you care?	There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --	Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --	I need a skin. Then we leave --
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's ... another exit?	Aye, for us there is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.	All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What? What?	Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?	Because that's where I found it. I was there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He must have been great-looking, right?	Why do you say that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Larry --	Forget him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Father...	Take a letter...
<EOC>	<EOC>
For what?	For being on to Dillinger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where we going?	We have to find Kittle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?	Considering what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I found a broken gasket, from space --	A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, did you remember that, or...	Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What!?	Have a good day, gentlemen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finished what?	Learning language.
Which one?	All 900.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.	Who the hell's Woogie?

<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you read?	Twenty eight.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.	Why?

<EOC>	<EOC>
This place?!	Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that? A hundred?	That's right, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.	Is it...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.	You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where does this Sugai live?	A resort city, Beppu.
I want to go talk to him.	What...?  Why?
Because he knows how to get to our man.	He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You smell that?	It's coming.  Run.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's work?	Well, same ol' same ol'.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!	Oh, yeah?
Yeah!	How much ya wanna bet?
Ten bucks.	You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?	It's very sore.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But you don't mind.	No, I don't mind.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How does it taste?	Just the way I remembered.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the point of this?	Does everything have to have a point?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How was your tour?	The usual.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack?	Coach, athletic director somewhere.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.	Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?	The Rodger Young just burned up...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Goodbye.	Oh, my...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Popcorn?	No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Operator.	Tank, it's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Been here long?	Just since yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.	You're saying this only to make me go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you angry at me?	No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm getting --- left behind.	Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm still shaking.	I can't believe Will killed him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is she?	Standing next to my window.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why didn't you kill her?	Why didn't you kill him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorsha.	Madmartigan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll carry the instruments.	Thank you, Daphne.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry I got you into trouble.	I'll survive.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can we do?	Nothing -- against all that force.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The right nostril.  Good.	My right nostril?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you want that cooked?	Medium rare, please.
Fries?	Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?	Yes, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the rubber band?	Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
<EOC>	<EOC>
IS THAT YOU?	IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.	You guys are fuckin' sick.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Call me as soon as you're settled.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Going to tell Ellie?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well...	Well...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	-- do you want ice?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Love ya.	Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want to talk about?	You know what about.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...	Kyle...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!	He's a fucking maniac!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?	You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.	Looking for him for what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Can't do it.	...What?
...I can't beat him.	Apollo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold me, Don.	Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!	I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.	That's right.  You're not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.	Monica.
And you know our friends, how?	We live next door.
Oh.  You're them.	Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.	You have?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus.	Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably must be.	So when was he here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. Later. I don't know.	Yes!
<EOC>	<EOC>
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.	Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must learn magic.	That's all I ever wanted!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why are you doing that?	I haven't brushed yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How did it go?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, remember -- keep it simple.	Don't worry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?	He's not coming.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!	Toward the Pole!
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mere. I want to talk to you.	Good. I want to talk to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
O.K. Let's go.	Kyle, you don't have...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...	We can do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long have you been living here?	For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?	Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think of this one?	I'd have to see it on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why do you think I'm sending him home?	He killed the dolphin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck! We are fucked!	Turn that fucking radio off!
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is fun...	Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it him?	Yup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you sure it is dead?	I'm going to put them on the cat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.	Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?	You wanna let me see your license, please?
<EOC>	<EOC>
C'mon.	Wait a second, I --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is everybody?	Down here....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to come in?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look adorable.	Thank you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something wrong?	Being back here. Gives me the willies.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Like popcorn?	I got some hair stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Scott on discrete.	Scotty, let's have it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.	Thank you. I learn a great deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bad habit.	I know. I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's make us even, shall we?	Even?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's your name, asshole?	Fuck you, Santa Claus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're here.  Where the hell are you?	Back here.  At the end of the block.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, good. Okay.	I'm cool.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can't kill me yet.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want?	I want to come in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello, I'm here about the ad.	Please, have a seat.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.	You sure you want me to?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Finally.	How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.	Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're taking a flight?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Isn't that nice. Since when?	Since he moved to L.A.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Absolutely not.	No pictures, either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.	But all these people...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, go on! Go berserk!	GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not on him, Chief.	Agent Hurley...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.	Put it on the screen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah... Northeast... sir.	Speak up boy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think?	Oh yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're really crazy.	You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?	Thought you was followin' me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's the way it happened, I know it is.	No, you don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, wait, are you-	Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!	GO Commander.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well?	In Vienna...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I beg your pardon?	W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?	No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?	Sure, boss.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We could put you into our witness protection program.	A hiding place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, are you?	Am I what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like the way I feel?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?	I poisoned him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Minneapolis... good.	You're full of tricks, aren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look, food!	That's not food.  Can't be food.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sir Galahad!	Oh ... hello ...
Quick!	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it set?	Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Erica, you coming?	Mm-mm.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lucky lady. Hi.	Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me a bottle of beer.	Right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now I'd like to be alone.	Oh.  Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what else is on this list?	It's private.
<EOC>	<EOC>
GET MAD!	But I just don't feel it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's your gun?	I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
NO!	Yes!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.	That good, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wouldn't know.	Oh, you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
There goes Mother.	Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.	Okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you, child?	I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.	What's the code?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!	David, come back here!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do not turn your back on me.	You are really going to force this, aren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's late. I'm headin' home.	Me, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have a man down...	Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...	Hold on, Coop...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know this guy?	His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jack, are you okay?	WhatÂ’s going on here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
[Lionheart, what happened?]	Something came up, Murman, my man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
From that music.	Oh!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sure.	You would?  Really?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.	Hmm?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You heard what I said, Dil?	My pills...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah?	...Let me just show you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing... There's your ninepence.	I'm not dead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I totally, totally hate you.	Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
<EOC>	<EOC>
W-w-w-we?	That's right.  Your toys.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Where did you steal the car?	It's Josh's.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you want from me?	I, I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I take your coat?	You're cold?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.	Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, I guess.	She plays the clarinet, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!	Walter shut up and relax!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not the way to talk to people.	Can I do anything I want?
No.	But, I am in charge.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?	Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you call anyone?	What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.	Look, my wife is understandably--
Jesus!	I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?	I didn't use my name.
What'd I tell you?	I called from a payphone!
What'd I tell you?	You told me no calls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's them.	It's too late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Half-red, half-black--
--that?--	--Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!	An integer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We should be so lucky.	Butt-ugly owl.

Look at him take it!	Do I set the goddam hook?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay?	I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They haven't harmed anyone.	Take them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We didn't come here for Day-Day.	Yes you did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?	I remember him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are we going?	That tall, bright building.  Near there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I gave you my card there.	Can I see your I.D.?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You here to see my mother?	Yeah.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.	Hungry?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one?	Going into the restaurant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's hard to go places, isn't it?	There's been an accident, Truman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!	What are you talking about?
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.	No way...  ...I wanna rock!
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Mummy has a special technique called ""Deep Therapy."""	What's that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, cut my finger.	I've got something in my bag.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That seems a shame. The night is young.	The night is two thousand dollars old.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd the damn truck go?!	Go to the water, it's that way!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
George! What are you doing here?	Just get in the van, Josie.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You can see for yourself.	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...

Access granted.  Male or female?	Male.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --	-- Waiter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.	I was close to being scared that time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's been a while.	This was my very first slow dance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Red. How long was it latched onto you?	I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Enjoy the day.	You too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any hot soup?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Intruder alert!	Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Promise you won't tell Brad.	Cross my heart and hope to die.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Find anything?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can he be missing?	Sir, about leaving --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.	Good. I'm glad that's settled!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four minutes.	What?
I waited another four minutes.	Shit.
Wait until he is on the stairs.	Right.
I'm taking off my mike.	Okay.
Electra --	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You see Major?  You are not so different...	I had no choice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Friday night...	Yes.  Do you have a date?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about Matt ?	Leave him, he's dead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm walking there Kris.	Walking where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.	Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!	It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will this work?	We'll find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Welcome home.	Do you know how much I missed you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Laurence!	I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You really are a very beautiful girl.	Just a romantic, that's you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Daddy??!?!?!	Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Where's Daddy?	Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.	What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gave her gifts.	Yes.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.	Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.	I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who put up my bond? Ordell?	In cash.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let Myrna finish.	Thank you.  And always smile.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This ain't workin' right!	What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	And you think I'm sick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi mom.	Hi Wendy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why am I doing this?	It's an experiment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do me.	I love you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sheriff, that's aggravating.	I'm ahead of you there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?	Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get your own room, Ashley.	Nick...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should call her.	I will.  See ya!
Right now.	Okay! Jesus!
<EOC>	<EOC>
She started shrieking, you know.	Jezhush.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are almost out of water.	We are almost out of everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>

It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.	How is everything?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say again, sir?	You heard me.  Move on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.	Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would ya like a glass of water?	...No thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
William Munny, yeah.	Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are movies about, Orson?	Forget it-

<EOC>	<EOC>
Go to it, handsome.	See you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's he smoking?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wasn't with you.	I know.
But you were with me.	Not you.  A copy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I looked it up.	How?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You going to tell her?	You going to tell him?
He doesn't need to know all my business.	He's gonna find out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's not for sale.	Who said I wanted to buy it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.	Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.	I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, bomb...	And I saw that I was alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?	Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You sure you wanna go there?	Uh...maybe?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.	We could make a run for it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, not while we're in Washington.	Oh............
We'll see when we get home okay.	When can I have one?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, it's up to Suzie.	It would be nice.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, what happened?	He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.	No way, man.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mother and son. You arranged this...?	I thought it might begin the healing process.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You missed on purpose.	I didn't. I told you, I can't --
<EOC>	<EOC>
I forgot where I put my keys.	And you thought they might be under her dress?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ho-lee shit.	This just got a hell of a lot better.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.	It is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kinda money, huh?	Classy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.	Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.	I don't drink.
It's for your finger.	One moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know.	What was her name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can you just take the plane like this?	Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
I can't....	Sure you can....
I don't know how....	No one does till they learn....
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have a question...	Who am I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eh, where's my grandfather?	Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.	Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can we, can we go?	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
See.  That's my name.	It's my name too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you through praying?	I'm through, Harry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.	Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.	Thanks.
<EOC>	<EOC>
General --- ?	We must combine our strength.
<EOC>	<EOC>
They must've taken it off me.	They?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No charge?	Your money's no good here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?	Sally?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Say goodbye, Mike.	You take care.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I was born, in New Orleans, too-	Really...?  Your family there...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'	I wonder if that's his doctor.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's incredible who's here.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tuna, this is crap.	I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Locked.	Stand back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're the doctor, what do you think?	She seems very unhappy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Woody, we don't know what's out there!	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lauren?	Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wouldn't say that.	Then what are you stopping for?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't believe that, Harry.	Gimme another explanation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We'll make it.	Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's this about?	Step out of the car please, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Kill me...	What did it do to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cue music...	What music?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Because he's a bitch.	That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...?	Run!
<EOC>	<EOC>
No... How?	The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.	We pushed it. We got lazy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Want to come to the study group?	Thanks but  I'd better do history.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?	I didn't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cut it back a little bit.	No fucking way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.	Son, don't --
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --	-- no.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.	Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.	Son, please, now....
DAD --	Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Howls.	We're not out of this yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...	Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Dad.	Hello, Lainey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't they come --	I don't know, Jabez.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, I guess not.	'Drugged' is a stupid word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But they both worked at the White House?	I will not talk about the other two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's one idea.	No...we want padded chairs...okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?	Bye.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.	Oh, of course.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning, Suzette.	Good morning, Madam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	Nothing.
Do you have the...	I'm  fine.  Really.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened?	Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?	It's a long story.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is it for real?	Get Fox.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't.  I have to know.	Please --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you feel like singing, Bob?	No way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But what if they try and scare us?	We'll scare 'em right back.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We are both from Prague.	How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.	I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Addison-!	So full of meaning, fire and music!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't kiss.	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?	Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?	They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.	Human?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I love you.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?	You are in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A dog at Victoria's Secret?	No, it was another woman.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, who's got access to it?	I guess I'm the only one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is the kitchen.	Yes, I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Brief marriage!  Ten years!	Was he in love?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!	Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you going?	I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
That's not true -- Where are you--?	Out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well done, lad.	Three cheers for our champion.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, not much longer to go.	What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.	Hope I make it through both.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She still packing for her trip?	I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, watch it!	Sorry there, old Spudhead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is that your professional opinion?	It's in the stars.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what girls are over there?	Natasha, Maria, Tina-
<EOC>	<EOC>
All right, all right.  Break it up.	Where you going, boss?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Eleven to seven he blows it.	Twenty on my man...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happened?	Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't seem to let go of you...	You hear me complaining about that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Show me again.	Annie!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.	Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You okay ?	Fine...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like ice cream, Doc?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you mean?	Do you know where I found this?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop -	Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!	Hold on a second.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tell me what to do.	The... chain helps.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"How do you say ""hospital"" in Japanese?"	Excuse me?
Hospital?	One moment, please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Next, Paine.	I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How can you do that?	Do what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...	You know I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.	You were having a nightmare.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What, sweetheart?	I want to see Pilgrim.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You got a girl?	No, and I'm not looking for one either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
ALAN!	KEEP GOING!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.	Please.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh yeah. Fine.	Thanks a lot, Ted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And--?	And I love poetry above all.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't screw around man, pull it!	You do it... you first!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!	You first!
<EOC>	<EOC>
One more after this, then I'm going home.	Set?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't think there were any houses up here...	You learn something new every day. Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now that's just gross.	GO, GO, GO!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hold on --	What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
For what?	Honesty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't make it easy on a fellow.	Didn't Paden tell you that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, man.	No. No, it's okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which one is she?	The beautiful one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lowell?	Did I tell you you were wrong?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this what they always look like?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, uh, where are you in school?	Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got you, Williams!	Go on -- shoot me!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Rennie...what'd they do to you??	Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's a very stupid question, Ross.	I'm asking it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why?	I hurt my finger.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Help me.	How can I?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Grable, not Gable!	Do Jimmy Durante!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, honey.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh, no...	Don't you think I would have told you that!
<EOC>	<EOC>
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.	What do I play?
You play--left field.	Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you even know these kids?	They hid my car--
<EOC>	<EOC>
You gotta think of your old age.	That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I could die.	So could I.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No-	Who are you? What is your name?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, straight talk only in here.	What about Kristen?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm still here.	You'd better be.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.	You are?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Screw you.	What'd you say?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want to get a drink first?	I think they'll probably have booze there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The cubicle across from you is empty.	But what if...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm still going in.	Hold on.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's on the television.	Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.	It does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
David --	Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?	Actually I'm running late --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Both of these.	Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, don't be silly.	Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
<EOC>	<EOC>
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?	No, thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Got something to say to me, Nick?	...ttt..tt... two out of three?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!	I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What'd you see?	I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.	Thanks, Ardelia.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All this, because you fell for Renard?	Five more turns and your neck will break.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm going for 'em!	No!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's really sad.	And it ruins everything else.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You call this a paranoid delusion?!	Doug...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Juno? What's going on?	Nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See you, Warren.	Bye, Ted.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You owe me fifty bucks.	Bob?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is she...alright?	I thought she was dead. For sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey baby...	Peanut...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are you fixed?	I'm okay, Matt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sorry I'm late...	What makes you think we're here to meet you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.	I'm just building up to it, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay Â–Â– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?	Okay.  What's yours?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What exactly is this place? Freezers?	Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this Ming?	It's not Ming. It's Tong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...when I...	...what has she done to harm you...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They won't recognize me.	Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.	We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Elliot lusts after you.	Based on what?  You never even see him.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You must think I like losing.	I think you like learning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We don't both have to die.	I couldn't do it. Not to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What happened, Joey...?	I can't talk now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
AAAAAAAAAAAA !	Cover us, Ace !
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong?	Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.	Come here, baby.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doctor!  What brings you here?	Just visiting my patient.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?	He's seriously disturbed...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Primary circuit is live.	Primary trigger switch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A film case.	That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is that?	It's a sign.  He's come home.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Have you ever had anal intercourse?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, let's get ready!	Sonny - Here's your document.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.	Oh my god, what happened?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got it on tape?	Clear as day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So what'd I miss?	You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
When?	When?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.	He likes you well enough to stick around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Repoed this morning.	I'll provide you with transportation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello.	Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.	Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Not yet, Jeff.	You haven't even heard from him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.	*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.	At the gallop!
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were brilliant today.	It's only the beginning.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.	Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I bought a new rug.	That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?	It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!	Jim?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!	Check this out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why is that funny?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Later.	Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?	He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.  Follow him.	He'll turn around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...	We're the old men, Ace.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got to be kidding.	What... is... happening... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	It's sex time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I disturbing you?	No... not at all.  Where are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's a dress code?	What are you here for?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.	Well, that's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who called this meeting?	Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.

I'm hungry.	Call room service.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it, Paul.	Stay with the children.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter?	Nothing... Let's get crazy!

Howard, they've disappeared again.	Oh dear.
<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.	Now we're talking.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And the other was Judd?	Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.	They'll be up there in a half hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just the prototype.	You hear that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?	No, Icky, this is real.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How long?	A matter of hours now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That's his headache.	His.
Oh, well.	Why are you lying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ready?	What are you saying?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!	Of course.  I'm a terminator.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- hey! --	-- ten.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you like them?	Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Let me guess. We're going on a ""long trip""."	Not according to these.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Christ...no time...	There never is.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I want to say something.	I don't want to hear it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks very much.	That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're leaving?	Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was that who I thought it was?	Uh huh.
Has this happened to you before?	Never, but I've been practicing.
Who are you, Jerry?	Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
<EOC>	<EOC>
"...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."""	What? Palace? Hardly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mummy!	Mummy!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.	There...

Can I help you?	I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Something big going on somewhere?	Going on right here. It's a big night.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you writing?	A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Come in.	Major Lavallette to see you, General.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry, Suzette.	Such nonsense.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You shouldn't have said that.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. They didn't answer.	I was told there were only two men there.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.	Maybe it's better that way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Someone out there.	Jesus fucking Christ.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.	Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?

What is it with you, anyway?	Still think we're finished?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....	How much money do you have in your pockets?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I haven't slept in weeks.	Why don't you try counting sheep?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay where you are.	Or what? You've gone round the bend --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go out there!  Stop him!	Sam, don't --

Let me speak to Clarence.	He wants to speak with you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You were late.	I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?	You want to go talk to him?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are these people?	I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good luck.	You, too.

It's Madison Fra--	STOP IT!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!	You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you all right, Dad?	Sure ... fine.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you drive?	Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't cry, Elizabeth.	Aren't you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?	Why yes, thank you.
Hot or cold.	Cold.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ezal!  Ezal!	Huh?
We must be here 'cause we stopped.	Good, let's get out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!	No, wait!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!	The hull's imploding!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who are you talking to?	To the shark.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Wow!	Wendy!

Hey, Kip ...	Hello, Memphis --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...	Tell me about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.	You'd suffer in her stead?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We've got to call the police.	All right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I like the gym smell.	Now take your panties off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they?  Shopping together?	They should be.  They're both good at it.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You just fucked a total stranger?	Shut the fuck up!

I assumed because of the train.	You assumed wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...	I don't understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You've got everything planned.	Everything.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I call 'em wiggers.	Different.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	May I talk to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.	They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!

Hey! Don't use all the hot water!	Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.	Bitch.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about fifteen hundred?	How about five hundred.

Small moves, Captain, small moves.	I can't move any smaller.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Spock... don't.	It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.	He's heading down the stairs, now..
<EOC>	<EOC>
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.	I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you like to come along?	We can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How are ya?	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, your chili's getting cold --	Not hungry.

Nice jugs.	They can't be real.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where do you get this shit?	Ricki Lake.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is a restricted area.	Check him out, Ray.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody knows.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
<EOC>	<EOC>
Quaid!  That's Quaid!	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who has your undies, Walter?	Where's your car, Dude?

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?	No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.	Has the hull been breached?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm not sure it's possible.	The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.	Okay.
What are you doing?	Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?	You did.
But I'm not through complaining yet.	Oh.

<EOC>	<EOC>
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.	They asked.
And what was your answer?	I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?	I think he's already figured that out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.	Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ah. One of the supporting characters.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm glad we got here in time.	Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll go.	Jeanne, no...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, do I look like a Man?	Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wonder if you could help me.	What?

You believe that?	I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening to them?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...	How would you know <u>anything</u>?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Getting rid of my hub!
<EOC>	<EOC>
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.	Who are you?!

What are you talking about? I'm freezing.	Get your clothes off!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bingo.	You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.	That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.	Osaka?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And that's tough, isn't it?	Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hands off your hip, Cole.	You're not scared, are you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	And the check is...

Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?	Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
<EOC>	<EOC>

But he's just a filthy criminal?	Way to go, Evy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The place is a mess.	I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.	I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who'd you call?	No one. I didn't have the number.

Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?	Come in, Alfredo.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing.	It's got to be.
<EOC>	<EOC>

What's he doing out there?	I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, shit...	Careful...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How do you like Santa Carla?	It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
<EOC>	<EOC>

He is!	Look, it's important.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good morning.	I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I didn't look like a bum.	But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Sarah listen to me.	Go away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be good to her, my lord!	I will.

<EOC>	<EOC>
That was truly excellent.	Yeah.
Time to check out the waiters.	I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Only a pig could do a thing like that.	Watch your tongue, boy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?	Of course, Wes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.	It was definitely the high point of the evening.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?	Of course I did.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?	This is it.
<EOC>	<EOC>

What's new?	Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?	For reading.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You came back for me.	Did you think I wouldn't?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.	Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What can I do for you?	Checking in...Karla Wilson.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.	I got no say over people.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.	What was the Donner party?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We can live with that.	I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, boy! A jacket!	Your mom made that all by herself.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Stop where you are.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
The money's right here! Get the key!	No! You get it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Three whips. To go.	When you get a chance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how'd you like LION KING?	Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.	You work too hard, John.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't goin'...	He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?	I finished it off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You look kind of cold.	I'm okay.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Lucius.	I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It wasn't a lunatic.	I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you.	Have a nice day.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy, Liberace.	Oh, would you grow up.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the best thing I can see tonight?	Me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.	Please, Barton.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What?	It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Karen. Wow. Look at you...	Hello, Martin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What did the doctor say?	We have to start looking for a shrink.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.	Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.	Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.	You've made me very happy, Johnny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Your equipment has crapped out again....	My equipment doesn't crap out....
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hello?	Dickie?
Who is it?	It's Freddie. Let me in.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi Loretta.	Hi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Alabama, could you tell Clar -	Ask him if he got the letter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you playing tricks on me?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...I'm Crane.	My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi...	If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thanks, guys.	I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Yeah.	Say hi to Naomi.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Anything?	We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where is he?	How do you know it was a 'he'?
All right -- where is she?	How do you know it was a 'she'?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!	Can you play it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's left of him.	Where? Where did you find it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mama let me help you.	NO!...She wanted me to do it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening?	We're leaving.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Twenty-after-ten.	Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you have any kids?	No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell?	What the--?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this a good spot?	I'm not burying him here...
Why not?	There's a better place...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, no, please!	Teddy, be brave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You ain't gettin' out o' here!	Now, where is he?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Put down Lex Luthor !	Put down Lex Luthor?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No! I don't want to leave you!!	Mathilda, listen!
<EOC>	<EOC>
That was so good I am gonna have another.	You can't have just one.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.	You need a nickname.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!	I noticed you staring.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?	Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I like it I guess.	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's be creative.	Excuse me?
<EOC>	<EOC>
She doesn't even want to leave the house.	Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not without my effects.	We need to go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why so nervous?	I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?	Screening calls. Any suggestions?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not it...?	Nice, Jack.  YouÂ’re sweeping me off my feet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fifty.	Fifty? We need seventy-five.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good evening. How are you feeling?	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
All of it.	It's not.
<EOC>	<EOC>
If you wouldn't mind.	Thank you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please, come, Holiness.	Yes. I am ready.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, you certainly had a good look around.	You were magnificent.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This must be business, there's nothing else here.	Follow it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
HER!	Arrest that woman!
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.	I'm from a small town too, you know.
Really?	Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Holy shit!	Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
<EOC>	<EOC>
"Hey there. They're showing ""Groundhog Day"" if you..."	You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.	Who do you think you are?
<EOC>	<EOC>
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.	Big surprise.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All street mimes should be executed.	... Looks like a convention.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let me up! Let me up!	All right. Sorry, George.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay.	Get him in here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No...	Please...
No...	Please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want me to take you somewhere?	Long as it's fun.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know you saw me.	What... ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Pop asked you.	I'm gonna kill somebody today.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi, Dad.	Doing some shopping?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Roy --	Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is Valentine here?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
...Hello...?	LAPD. Open the door.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That J.D. kid is a little shit.	What.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This must be Beast.	That's Mr. Beast to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's up, Colonel?	I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where were you last night?	That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?	I never make plans that far ahead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about...	What about what?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I knew you were trouble.	Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about... the Savage Six?	The Inscrutable Six?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They guys treatin' you all right?	Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Indy! Help me!	Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.	Well I bet you they're happy.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.	What do you want with old man Faz?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Give me his name, I will mail him.	OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.	Yeah... How do you know it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Look at her.	She don't look Jewish.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See that tram coming around the corner?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't blame you!	Eve, I'm sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way.	It has to be done.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Guess I kind of lost it there.	You could say that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Which way?	Across both tracks!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I should go with her, Sandy.	Go ahead.
Sandy?	Go ahead!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Name?	Hammond.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh! I'm sorry...	It's okay. Didn't hurt..
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's all right, Chet.	It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Things have been kind of stressful lately.	But everything's OK?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I help you?	I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Applejack drove.	Run. Run. Let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.	Hello?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, is this your father?	No. My uncle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?	Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you totally insane?!	I almost saw Catalina.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good God.	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I am the Walrus.	That fucking bitch!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't start, Farmer.	It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The chauffeur. He's watching.	He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.	I know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's inside the complex.	You're just reading me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You listening to me?	Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...	Two...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?	The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So much pain.	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.	It's better that way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I wake you?	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I heard that.	Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Probably he means no harm.	He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.	Yes, some of the time.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We made a deal with Barrack One.	Any news on Dunbar?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!	Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You would not believe what--	Shhh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who needs vermouth?	We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	A meat locker.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, Hannah!	It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!	He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!	He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mu Bai...It's been too long.	It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?	Fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What sort of injury did he have?	Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
<EOC>	<EOC>
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!	Yeah. That's love.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Marty, ignore him.	He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not even a rhinoceros?	Imposserous!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank...	Don't stop now! Please...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Uh...	Move with the music.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He certainly has your number, Alan.	YouÂ’re a little tougher, Peter.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Open it up.	Here...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why so few?	Faith.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Doc!  How the hell are you?	Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?	Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey! How was your first day at school?	It sucked.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He seemed harmless.	Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You cannot kill what is already dead.	Let her go!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where's the woman?	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.	All right! Oh, yeah!
<EOC>	<EOC>
There's heat coming the door.	Back away then.
Wait a minute --	I said back away.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?	Hey buddy. You okay ?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now where? Will?	To the Palace at Whitehall.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Popeye.	Yeah.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.	I can't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Beautiful!	What was?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It could be parasites, an infection...	A reaction to AZT...
<EOC>	<EOC>
So how'd you like the house?	His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Go on!	No!
That's an order!	Fuck your orders!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hi.  Donna Irving?	Yes?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?	You're a lawyer?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?	I... I need a drink of water.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What belongs to the people?	All this. All of it.
What people?	I don't know... but it does.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Great	Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yesterday.	Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is certainly... ah...	I only found out you were here yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's not do this, okay?	I need to know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?	It's had a meal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --	Educate her, Pyro.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing!	I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!	It won't work.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.	Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You don't remember me, do you?	We know each other?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's mine is mine.	Come on, Walter!.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Was she pretty?	Who?
The girl I remind you of.	She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hate both parties.	And I'm a Republican.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I told him to leave me alone.	Landon --
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.   He's a good man.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
He said open it.	Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Angelo!  Don't fire!	Kid, get outta the way!!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Small space?	Don't though.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He did something with the ground.	Yes?
Can you do it?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
He married his cousin.	Who?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What you gettin' all pretty for?	Why don't you relax, Frankie?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Talley.	It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get out of here!	Wait a minute, GordonÂ—IÂ—
<EOC>	<EOC>
GUARD! GUARD!	Alamo...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Natalya?	Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.	I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!	And with that complete loser
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the fuck is that?	They'll cut the power.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Dad?	It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have helm control.	Where's the Sphere?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.	George, I don't --
<EOC>	<EOC>
What number did you tear out?	Eh?
What number, on the first page?	... Two-thirty-seven.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you see it?  What was it?	We'll get back to you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You're going to steal the leads?	Have I said that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you know about this place?	I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?	Yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...	What kind of bomb was it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?	Me? No, I'm not good for much...
<EOC>	<EOC>
How about a lift, mister?	Can't you see that sticker?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know. It's been a while.	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Okay.	Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?	Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What...what is that?	A story?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell's his problem?	Don't worry about it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you get it a little closer?	That's what I'm going to do.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Man look at that get up !	Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, there - open up!	Come on out!  We're friends!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here I am, Father.	Take a letter.
Who to?	The President of the United States.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?	Yes.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?	They're too big.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Circle?	Close -- but definitely wrong.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey.	Hey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I know what happened.	I bet you fucking know!
<EOC>	<EOC>
What do you think?	I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.	Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.	It's not my taste.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah, they showed me	Could be unrelated.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?	No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You the new guy?	So they tell me...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong with him?	Must be the pressure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have a visitor.	Hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.	Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Reed. How close are we to a cure?	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.

<EOC>	<EOC>
You again.	Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So they'll go.	I'm only paying two of you guys.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
What about you?	I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Would you remove your hat please?	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
She's shy.	Oh.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Stay here.	Be careful -- there're two of them.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How much do you owe?	Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?	I told you, all bets are off.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Same here.	The pleasure is mine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey, what's happened to you?	Nothing. Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.	Which is why he doesn't need us.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you tell Dad?	Not yet.
Are you going to?	I don't know.
Is this bad for him?	What do you think?
<EOC>	<EOC>
They're bypassing Engineering...	Where the hell are they going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?	I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?	Sure... What's Grace up to?

Hi, babe.	Hi, hon.  How's it going?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Objection, we've...	...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...	...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are you from any way?	Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You want her sheets?	We can just take this pillowcase.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say not here!  Cuba!	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ask me when we get home.	Oh, my <u>program</u>...

Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.
That's what I told them.	Good.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's that?	Hm?

Is this your place ?	Do you care ?
No, not much.	Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?	That's right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Why did you move the body, Doctor?	To place it inside its coffin.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The whales...?!	No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override -- ?	It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!	Admiral, you'll be trapped!

It's like jelly.	There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where'd you get the clown suit?	Like it?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say it again.	Alla puttanesca.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I thought everything was checked out.	I had 'em hid in the foreign section.

There are soldiers.	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about all these letters?	Read 'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>

Okay?	I think so... I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
It is, Billy.	Then we got'em!
<EOC>	<EOC>
He'll kill us.	Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.	So what do we do?
I don't know.	We should stop seeing each other.
<EOC>	<EOC>
...That's an old one.	Buy us some Thunderbird, man.

<EOC>	<EOC>
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?	No, Nick, please --

Why all the way to Del Rio?	I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.

Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.	But where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where you plugged-in from?	New York.

Gee, I'm really sorry.	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did I hear the word...	Luke.  Can't live like that.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well--shall we go into dinner?	I'll join you later.

Six to the left. One to the right.	He's on vacation.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nick?	Right here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Keep it.	You're sure?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And will the dead ever return, Freya?	That I cannot tell you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?	White meat will be fine...
<EOC>	<EOC>
What are you doing?	Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?	I'm going to the store.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh these moments do try me...	Be gentle.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Come, I'll take you home.	I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.	I'm used to it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shit!!	It's my subway defense system.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Jackie, go play in the snow.	Why?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Two...	That's it, you look like a professional.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What the hell are we arguing about?	I don't know...You...I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes?	The flowers... they're beautiful.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And what do you call this?	- The family jewels?

We'll dance.	All right. We'll dance.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	"""No""?  ""No"" to which part??"

Doesn't have a head, does he?	This one came unassembled.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Tank, you're hurt.	I'll be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Good to see you, son.	It's good to see you, Dad.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --	The phone's out.
Yeah. Well, we can just --	Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.	That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Four...	Jim...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do that again.	What.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please. Please don't walk away.	I just can't look at you the same way.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've got one favor to ask.	What can I do for you, George?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw Michael!	Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh, no.  Oh, no.	What was that?  What the Christ was that?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can I do it again tonight?	We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What is it?	Bang up stuff.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...	Good. Let's begin to move these people out...

<EOC>	<EOC>
I know you.	You know my back.
What are you still doing here, Randall?	Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
<EOC>	<EOC>
No.	No?
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's an important issue.	Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Do you want some dinner?	I'd love some.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What about the bank?	Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.	G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nice talking to you, Travis.	Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.

I got something on the screen.	You do?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?	No...
<EOC>	<EOC>

PeterÂ—	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you consider that?	Yes. Yes, I will.
<EOC>	<EOC>
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.	She could be moving money, guns. Anything.

You were right. She's still pissed.	Sweet love, renew thy force!
<EOC>	<EOC>
'Bike fine point?'	Bic... It's a Bic pen.

Objection!	Sustained.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But I didn't open it! I didn't!	Then why are you here?
<EOC>	<EOC>

Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.	Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?	Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Will you kill me?	Sure.
<EOC>	<EOC>
A hundred dollars!	The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?	Make it fast.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Planning on getting --	Remarried.  There is no move.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Can you see?	Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Well, Sampson, what is it?	Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.	No. Hey. We're sorry, man!

<EOC>	<EOC>
I saw you on your bike today.	With Mikey?
Who?	Nobody.
Mikey Williams?	We were just riding around.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What was that?	An accident.  No one was hurt.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I hope we get some more help.	I wish it would rain...
<EOC>	<EOC>
No way butt-hole! I want the window.	Cut it out butt-hole!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Shall I look after the rest?	Don't you dare, I'll be back!

<EOC>	<EOC>
My God! The Bumstead contracts!	Oh my God, sir!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yep.	Holy shit. That's all true?

What courthouse?	Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Let her know what?	That you love Mary.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Yes.  Just about here.	But there's nothing here.
<EOC>	<EOC>
That sounds good.	Two.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know - I'm American.	So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.	So how many miles do you think it is?
<EOC>	<EOC>
No, this hurts.	YAAAAAAAA !
<EOC>	<EOC>
I've always wanted a watch like that.	It's yours.

For me...?	What the hell.  For you....
<EOC>	<EOC>
HE'S GONE.	What?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Me.	And who do I go to about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
People have the right to know.	If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ten here.	Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.	I went over last night, too.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You real down?	I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Let's hack her to pieces.	No.
<EOC>	<EOC>

Don't you ever point a gun at me!	I'm -- I'm sorry...
<EOC>	<EOC>
That is...if you're not doing anything.	Oh no. I have no plans.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Right on the button.	Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
<EOC>	<EOC>
So...now what?	Could we make it to the mountains?
<EOC>	<EOC>
This is where to be.  High and dry.	And alone.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.	You know, there's something we never really thought of...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Papa, is this your idea?	Mine?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Harder.  Concentrate harder.	Me arm hurts.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You have kids, Jack?	Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.	What?  <u>Why</u>?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I have to get back.	Too bad...
<EOC>	<EOC>

What is this, Rogoff?	I don't know yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.	With that coxswain dickhead.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who is it?	It's me.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You broke some.	Whatever. Sorry.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You should call your Grandmother.	Shuddup.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?	That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I don't know what's going on. I--	What happened to you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Please.	I won't let you have it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Get the hell outta here!	Man, it's just, like, conversation.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are they heading?	Inland.
Santa Rosa?	Maybe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Are you afraid?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Now, that's all right, isn't it?	You betcha.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Okay, fellows.	Take it easy, John Doe.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?	I'll smile when it's funny.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You think there was a connection to--	Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Where are the Cookies?	You mean Fred and Ginger?
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'll probably go back to it someday.	Uh-huh.
<EOC>	<EOC>
See ya, Bandit.	See ya, Kate.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Be careful.	Here? You gotta be kiddin'.

My God... these people are insane.	Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Who?	Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?	He's my brother.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?	It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?	Oh well, you know.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.	Don't.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Did you tell him?	Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
<EOC>	<EOC>
And where do you lead, boy?	To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.	That I promise you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
How you doing, Artie?	I... You know... I...

Those are the Hoyts.	I don't care. They're out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
You know how to drive one of these things?	Can a pig whistle?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing for you to see.	Leggo...
<EOC>	<EOC>
Thank you for coming, Dick.	Winning?
<EOC>	<EOC>
We're all alone, aren't we?	Michael's around someplace...
<EOC>	<EOC>
You take one more step, I'll kill her.	You'd do her a favor.

How's school?	I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?	Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.	Yes.

I didn't expect anyone.	No reason.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?	Round about, yeah.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What a good week.	You mean nobody died?
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Hurry!	I can't do it! I can't do it!
<EOC>	<EOC>
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...

'Bye.	'Bye.

You haven't done that in a long time...	What...?
What you're doing to my neck...	Was I doing something to your neck?

Shut up.	I didn't say a word.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing like last time, promise.	Alright.

<EOC>	<EOC>
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?	I am not a dream.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Were you planning to tell me?	We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
<EOC>	<EOC>
I tripped over a chair.	Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?	You don't have the stomach for it.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Really?	We'd like to hire you.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh God, Lins... I--	Tell me later.

Are you okay?	I'll be fine.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Frank, don't you have something to say?	You're doing just fine.

What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?	She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Aren't you going to answer it?	Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's happening up here?	I think it's fizzled out.
<EOC>	<EOC>
I'm stayin', Homer.	Okay. Then you can be of use.

My documentary is due on Tuesday.	What's your subject?
<EOC>	<EOC>
You could hear them?	Yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But there were other factors.	Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Nothing further, your Honor...	Mr. Concannon...?
<EOC>	<EOC>
And your hand too.	I took the bandage off yesterday.
<EOC>	<EOC>
What's wrong, Danny?	Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
<EOC>	<EOC>
The fifth room is your broadcast room.	Good. I'd like to book a massage.
<EOC>	<EOC>
We have to meet.	One hour.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.	Oh, yes.
<EOC>	<EOC>
All part of the Service we Render.	He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
But... wait a minute...	The majority has spoken.
<EOC>	<EOC>
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.	We'll be all right.
<EOC>	<EOC>

<EOC>	<EOC>
Not enough against their shields.	Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Oh no.  I smell it.	Keep the animal quiet.
<EOC>	<EOC>
-- but he didn't.	Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.	Found?  Where?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.	Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Mom, I mean dad...	In a minute...
<EOC>	<EOC>
It's OK. There's no problem.	You mean I can have the room?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Hey... you guys OK?	How about you?
<EOC>	<EOC>
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.	Art thou hurt?
<EOC>	<EOC>
For a while I thought I might go crazy.	I know how that can be.
