# Load & Preprocess Data
# ----------------------
#
# The next step is to reformat our data file and load the data into
# structures that we can work with.
#
# The `Cornell Movie-Dialogs
# Corpus <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__
# is a rich dataset of movie character dialog:
#
# -  220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie
#    characters
# -  9,035 characters from 617 movies
# -  304,713 total utterances
#
# This dataset is large and diverse, and there is a great variation of
# language formality, time periods, sentiment, etc. Our hope is that this
# diversity makes our model robust to many forms of inputs and queries.
#
# First, we’ll take a look at some lines of our datafile to see the
# original format.

# Create formatted data file
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# For convenience, we'll create a nicely formatted data file in which each line
# contains a tab-separated *query sentence* and a *response sentence* pair.
#
# The following functions facilitate the parsing of the raw
# *movie_lines.txt* data file.
#
# -  ``loadLines`` splits each line of the file into a dictionary of
#    fields (lineID, characterID, movieID, character, text)
# -  ``loadConversations`` groups fields of lines from ``loadLines`` into
#    conversations based on *movie_conversations.txt*
# -  ``extractSentencePairs`` extracts pairs of sentences from
#    conversations
#

# Splits each line of the file into a dictionary of fields
